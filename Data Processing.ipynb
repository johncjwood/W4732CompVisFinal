      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk980.wav :  so what they do is they take the fit, the epa and dha, and they put this like ethanol backbone, they usually it has a glycerol backbone on it, which makes it a triglyceride. and they take that off and they do this ethanol backbone. it's part of the molecular distillation process, how they distill it, get the imperities away.. \n",

      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk990.wav :  so the thing about the phospholipid form, much like when we were talking about with liposomes is, so the thing with phospholipid form is that the dha and epa and creole oil can be easily absorbed by this malintestine for one, it can be absorbed in its intact form without having to undergo all this enzymatic cleavage stuff, so it can just be absorbed in tack and get transported to the cholesterol, a clylmicrons, like hdl, ldl, that can be transported there.. \n",

      " the joe rogan experience train my nature, rogan podcast my night, all day doctor ronda, i presume. good to see you again. good to see you too. last time i saw you, i introduced you to the wonderful world of head trauma..  indeed. dr. ronda got her first experience of a live ufc event and.  just to preface it you really didn't know much about the ufc at all before you went to this thing with your husband and it was.  well, you're pretty shocked. yes, to be honest, i had no clue until....  i think i had been like the morning of, or the day before. and i was like the morning of the day before, i was like that..  i looked it up and it was like i saw people were like in the cage fighting and it was like.  holy crap. i thought it was, you know, totally. i don't know even know what i was expecting. it was just some kind of wrestling thing or something you know, i think i was confusing it with the ww e? e? is that what it is? the wrestling? the ww-something wrestling. yeah, that. so, ufc, i mean, just these little three letter acronyms, you know. so you had really never been exposed to any sort of mixed martial art form? no. not mixed martial art. i mean, i was....  you know, aware of things like type one dough and all that, but i just know that they exist and that they're kind of cool and that's about it. yeah. had you ever been to a boxing match before? no, i had never been to a boxing match..  and i've really never really watched one. i've seen probably....  clips or pieces of it like.  throughout my life at some point, but.  um..  just no exposure in general. i don't have a sports gene in my sports genes. while i love to like work out and exercise and you know i'm very addicted to the brain benefits and other benefits..  i have never really like watched sports..  we're being like interested in it like.  in general and i try really hard because my dad is a huge sports fan. oh my god, he plays baseball. i mean he's 65 and he still plays baseball..  on like a men's league. so, and he watches football, basketball, like any sport, any like manly sport, you know, he watches, he knows everything about and....  he's not a big science guy, so i try really hard to bond with him. when i'm with him, i'm like trying really hard to be interested or like he'll take me to a padre's game, you know what i'm saying?.  i'm like, i try to understand what's happening, but it takes a lot of work for me..  with that said that whole that mma experience was very unique because i've been to a baseball game i've been to a football game, been to basketball games, so those are.  the sports that i've actually spectated live at some point in my life, but.  the mma was a very different experience..  it felt very like....  there was kind of a tribal component to it where you've got, i mean, a people cheering when the fighters are coming down the aisle and....  i don't know the way the music drums and stuff are going, i'm something beating and then this the whole....  people fighting in a cage made me feel like this..  you know, times back in the roman coliseum where they'd go and watch people fight..  there's a lot of that in it..  there's definitely a lot of tribal element of the music. different people from different cultures have different music. a lot of the country music guys or country guys will come out to country songs. and guys who are more urban will come out to the rap songs. a lot of white guys come out to rap songs too..  but you know some guys would come out to like classic rock and everybody's like yeah love that song. i'm gonna root for this dude.  but there's definitely an element of that in it. oh yeah, the music was cool and that i think that....  also gave that tribal feeling, but then the cheering and how people were like i had it just there's something moving inside of me that i was not expecting. and then so it was cool in that regard where i was like oh this feels like some unique experience that i wouldn't get at you know they haven't ever experienced that any sort of other..  sport event that i've attended. so when you said something was moving inside of you, do you mean like you were emotionally means like you got excited, your heart raised? yeah, yeah. i felt like it was part of some community that, you know, i was like, well, this is some kind of community that i get to experience for, you know, a day..  yeah, it was it was some sort of unique event where i felt like i was just.  you know connecting with these people that are around me. it's a very addictive community too..  i can imagine it was a lot of fun, you know, it was a lot of fun. aside from me, you know, looking at.  the effects on, you know..  the brain and stuff what a lot of these fighters are experiencing aside from that it was it was a lot fun i really really liked that was the thing we all went out afterwards a giant group of us afterwards went out to eat and you just were wide-eyed you had like like saucer eyes and you were like the the amount of damage that you just couldn't i couldn't stop calculating the amount of damage that was going on to these people's brains irreversible damage like yes well that and coupled with our conversation the night before where i'm.  you know, denny was talking about friends that were fighters that....  you know, having memory problems. and immediately when he started describing some of those..  you know....  characteristics, i was like that sounds just like in alzheimer's..  i mean, i patient and....  just because i wasn't really aware of any of the mma..  community, what it involves, what sort of, you know. it seems like there's a lot of, you know, there's not a lot of rules. like....  you know, you can punch someone in the head, you can kick, you can choke, you can, in a boxing, i don't think they can kick. so it seems like there was a lot of other stuff going on that was very traumatic. it's so funny. listen to you describe it because you're so educated in science and the human body and the effects of vitamins and various nutrients in the human body. so to see you, like get your first exposure to....  what's like a normal part of my life? like it's like a daily part of my life essentially is being exposed to this stuff so it's it's fascinating to watch you like i don't think they can kick and boxing. yeah you're so removed you're an alien like you've come from another planet and landed in the world of mma for a day.  yes, that that that is kind of how i felt.  wow, but.  i'm right, right? they're picking his... you're right, you're right, you're right. well, there is a thing called kickboxing. there's a company called glory and they hold these events on spike tv, which is an american cable channel. and they're allowed to kick. they kick and they can knee. they can't elbow though. it's like a modified version of what's called moitai and moitai is tieboxing..  and in thailand, they're the experts in this very particular type of kickboxing. where they do a lot of clinching, they grab a hold of each other and knee each other in the body and the head and the elbow from the clinch and they throw a lot of leg kicks they're known for their kicking ability. okay, yeah, i've seen muay thai like.  on twitter and people like you know tweeting at me and stuff but i really didn't know exactly what it was moat eyes pretty wild. i actually i didn't even realize people used kickbox i thought kickboxing was like a way to work out like it's not like actually people fighting seriously like really really thought that it was just a way to work out until just now wow that's so crazy i'm in another world. i do a lot of i was telling my husband the other day like you know people on weekends they go out and they they go camping and they hike and they go and they you know go to the woods and they find you know see all these new things in the forest and which i love to do by the way, but.  everyday what i do is i'm like hiking and forging through the human body and it's like every day i'm doing this constantly and.  i do get a little um....  you know, i'm sort of sheltered from a lot of other things because i'm just like always.  reading about science and health and mechanisms and so.  at times i'm, you know, with other things that are so common knowledge to people..  kind of like blow people's minds where i'm like no i didn't know. like what are the things? are you like completely cultural norms that you're completely unaware of?.  well, a lot of sports things definitely. television stuff, you know, just any of that..  television world and people always you know relate to commercials and like i.  nothing. it's like just years without a tv. so i have a tv and i still don't relate to a lot of... someone just explained to me that the show bones on fox has been on for like six years or something. it was on the other day in a hospital waiting room. i was watching it..  and i was like, what the, this show is, how long has it been on? and like, it's been on forever. i was like, what? come on..  like there's so many shows i have no idea what they are i'll pass by us weekly with someone on the cover you know she's leaving him she started like who the fuck is she who's he who are they apparently their huge liberties right i have no idea who they are yeah that's that's so i'm i'm in that sort of.  mindset, mindset, so but you know back to the to the ufc event..  yeah, so the watching event was really exciting, but um....  starting to look at these blows that people were taking to their head..  choking there seems to be a lot of choking going yeah, and you know some of those sort of.  i was in there just from what i knew at the time it was already like wow this this seems like you know.  some stuff's going down basically well the choking though. it's not as dangerous. yes, it's not the the issue with choking is.  any grappling you're gonna develop micro trauma and you're gonna have disk issues as you get older you're gonna have just just a lot of a lot going on with spine. uh-huh, you know, and so there's some trauma but for the most part the choking is not too dangerous. there's one repeated issue that's been happening a lot lately. never happened in ufc.  but it's been happening in small organizations and it's a very particular move where someone will go for a takedown.  which is, you know, you try to, they're standing up, and you try to take the guy down..  and then the person who they're trying to take down..  gets the guy in what's called a guillotine choke and a guillotine choke is your head is trapped under the armpit and you have your forearm underneath the neck and you're pulling up on the neck and then the person who's caught in the guillotine tries to take the person down.  by like picking them up and trying to throw them and they land on the guy's head and that people are becoming paralyzed from it..  it's happened several times. it's happened in training a couple times and it's happened a couple times in fights, but it's enough of an issue where it's starting to scare the shit out of me. you know that guys who get caught in guillotine try to slam their way out of it. they try to pick a guy up and slam their way out of it instead of trying to be technical and grab a hold of their hand and try to....  work your way out of it. it's just because that choke is so sudden when you get caught in it. it's such a nasty choke that the there's like one or two seconds where you have with a guy who's really good where you have to breathe..  where, you know, otherwise you're....  you're pretty much going to go unconscious. yeah, so that's one thing i was wondering with the choking specifically was, you know, because,.  choking, you know, you can, to some degree, cause some hypoxia in the brain. so, you know, you're not causing ischemic damage, which is like no oxygen getting in the brain, but you may have reduced oxygen. and the body compensates for that. the body will, because it senses that less oxygen is getting in the brain, it increases blood flow, you know, as a compensation..  but if that can't compensate, what happens, you know, you'll start to eventually like your motor control will get affected. and i was wondering if they use that as a technique..  like because.  then that they're because they're choking their opponent. now their opponent's motor control gets, you know, affected. no, the goal is just put the guy to sleep..  which is even worse because that's the next step which then you become you know that happens all the time. yeah, so and there is you know that that hypoxic damage you know there is damage occurring what kind of damage is occurring when i get choked out completely asleep well completely asleep. so you're talking about you know not enough oxygen getting the brain for just you know a few yeah a few seconds one of the thing that can happen is that you can have a lactate buildup.  so....  so your brain, so you have neurons and you have supporting cells in your brain called astrocytes and gleocells, but astrocytes are a specific type of gleocells.  they're really important. they do a lot of things for the brain and they make up like 50% of the human brain volume..  they actually they use glucose.  and they use glucose in a way where they don't need their mitochondria, so they use glucose through something called glycolysis..  and the byproduct is they make lactate..  and the reason they do this is because the lactate then....  goes into the neuron and it goes right into the mitochondria and is used to produce energy but that needs to be coupled to oxygen..  lactate is a really great source of energy for neurons because it's....  it's not..  to cut for the neuron to convert glucose into.  highway.  which then gets used as energy at cost energy..  but for lactate to get converted into pyruvate to then be used as energy, it's thermodynamically favorable because it doesn't cost any energy to do that..  so um....  but this requires oxygen. this is the oxidative phosphorylation mechanism that i've talked about before..  but when you don't have oxygen there, then the lactate..  can't be used by the neurons..  and so lactate will then build up and can cause..  you know, it can cause a cell death..  when you have too much lactic acidosis building up in the brain, now that i don't!.  you know, with the amount of choking, i don't think that's much of an issue because this is more for like a wheel..  like real trauma, like intense trauma, more like a head trauma, blow to the head, or even like the rapid acceleration and deceleration that occurs..  car accidents mostly. yeah, i don't think the you know the blows to the head you know people's heads are moving but.  it's not like a car hitting you where it's like..  really, really rapid acceleration deceleration. that's a real problem..  so.  i think, you know, once i started to dive into this....  i started to read about traumatic brain injury, and specifically i became interested in it because of the alzheimer's connection. it was like....  whoa, wait a minute. why are these young people?.  coming down with symptoms of alzheimer's, like in like....  early, early age. like that, there's some connection between the way the normal brain ages and....  something that's happening with traumatic brain injury. so i became really interested and started reading about it, you know, since i....  went to that ufc event and.  really? uh....  fascinating, you know, i've been reading a lot about it and.  you know, these fighters, fighters, nfl players, you know, people boxing anyone that's taking blows to the head..  whatever sport that's....  some, you know, in some regard, you know, i think even rugby, things like that. you know, these people have a.  increased incident of alzheimer's in some cases just two or three fold increased case of alzheimer's..  and....  and it's an earlier onset, you know, and it's....  very indistinguishable in terms of some of the pathology that occurs in their brain compared to someone who's....  you know, 75, 85 years old and getting alzheimer's..  so.  i started reading about this like what's going on?.  and what happens is like even just a single blow to the head..  um, can cause..  you know, it can increase the risk for alzheimer's. so when you're having multiple repetitive injuries, that's....  increases the risk even more..  and so....  initially, there's a lot of changes that happen, but when you have a blow to the head, you've got the acute damage that happens. so, you know....  tissue damage you can get like diffuse axonal injury things like that and that's from like a real trauma to the head but.  even just like mild repetitive trauma, what happens is....  you get tissue damage and you release a lot of reactive oxygen species, which i've talked about before, which are released every day, we're releasing that in our brains and our other cells through just normal metabolism. it's kind of like a byproduct of normal metabolism. so in people that are not getting brain injury, it's happening a little bit each day..  but with the brain injury, when you're getting a blow to the head, it entices a massive, massive amount or release of it..  and it starts to damage the meninges, so which form a protective..  membrane around the brain..  and those cells start to die..  reactive oxygen species as a protective mechanism, it causes cells to die. and the reason it does, i've talked about reactive oxygen species before in the context of cancer. when you get a little bit of reactive oxygen species such as normal metabolism, you can cause damage to dna..  and, you know, when you damage the dna, you can either repair that damage. if you don't, you can get a mutation. eventually, that builds up and leads to cancer..  but if you have a huge burst of it, like in the case where you're getting an injury, then you're talking about a protective mechanism that kicks in, which is like, okay, i need to kill the cell..  and the reason i need to kill a cell is because i don't want to get all that damage that's going to cause a mutation to get me cancer..  so it's a protective mechanism. so it's killing cells to protect itself? yes, that's the biological mechanism as to why this huge burst of reactive oxygen species does kill cells. it's a concern, an evolutionary concern mechanism. and it really is important. if you stand, that's why part of the underlying mechanism for radiation in terms of treating cancer. radiation is, you know, your causing double-stranded breaks in dna. it's just like you're damaging the dna. and it's a huge amount of damage..  so it causes cells to die..  so this is happening in the brain and it's really not a good thing because.  in the sense, on the acute injury, you've got these meningi cells that start to die and then ostracize which like....  part of them like help form some of the blood-brain barrier..  they start to die..  and when those astrocytes start dying, that form the blood-brain barrier, what happens is the blood-brain barrier gets leaky..  and now you have things like potassium, chloride, sodium leaking into the brain and causing astrocytes to swell, causing water to flow in and you get a demon in the brain. i looked at this guy, mark dominic, i think if you could go, you can see a picture of his.  you know swollen and deem at like head and it's just like unbelievable.  so that's part of the cause of this adema. so now what happens is....  that reactive oxygen species of dead cells, the blood brain barrier gets compromised. immediately when that happens, this immune system in the brain gets activated. so you have another part of glial cells called microglia, which are like the immune cells in the brain..  they get activated when the blood brain bear gets damaged and they migrate up and they're trying to like plug up the hole..  so they're like, oh my god, the blood brain barrier has been compromised, so they might go up and they start trying to plug up the hole..  the problem is, is now you've activated this whole immune response..  where it starts to cause the lump..  yeah, look at that.  i mean that's just....  so, awful. when you see a lump like that, that fight should be stopped immediately..  yeah, i would say was did he keep fighting after that? yeah, he fought another round..  and one, one the final round with a....  big injury like that..  just unbelievable, honestly. so in your opinion, as a medical professional, when you see that kind of swelling,.  this is not a guy who should be hitting the head again..  no, i would say definitely not. there's a lot of consequences that can occur when you're....  so when you already have this type of damage where you're even..  this immune system has been activated. i mean you're getting so that's not just i'm sorry to interrupt you, but that's not just a wound that's bleeding under the skin.  that's part of the thing that's happening, but in addition to that, you've got all sorts of cellular changes that are occurring..  you're getting, you know, like i said, damage to the meninges, damage these astrocytes that are, you know..  performing the blood brain barrier and then you start getting those, they start dying. and when they start dying, a dead cell, you know, in addition to the microglia, the immune system, and the brain getting activated to try to plug up the damage, it also, as soon as you have cells dying, which in a case like this, when you've got massive damage, it's happening on a huge scale..  these microglia, they try to like eat up and get rid of all the cellular debris. i mean, that's part of what they do, the program to do. you know, they get activated when you have a bunch of dead cells and they try to go eat away this damage..  and the problem is is that when that starts to happen..  you're getting a, you're starting a cycle of neuro inflammation in the brain, which is very bad..  and you know what happens even.  within like hours of an injury like that..  is you start to get accumulation of something called amyloid beta..  plaques.  in the brain. so....  you know?.  traumatic brain injury and alzheimer's, they have a lot in common..  in the sense where traumatic brain injury is massive amount of damage and it's happening in one instance..  even just mild, you know, repetitive injuries. you may not get someone that has a swollen head like mark, but, you know, just taking a little blows to the head. also, you know, you're causing, you're activating....  you know, reactive oxygen species are causing cells to die and you are activating the immune system, even with a mild injury..  and what happens is that in addition to activating this immune system, then this also causes the accumulation of these amyloid beta plaques to accumulate in the brain..  amoloid beta plaques is one of the major pathologies associated with alzheimer's. what happens is, as we age, we have a little bit of inflammation going on in our brain. we have cells dying. we have....  you know, this is on a little bit by bit scale every day and so by the time, you know..  seven, eight decades go by..  we've accumulated enough damage that stuff starts getting messed up. amaloid beta, plaques, they form outside of neurons in between glial cells and neurons..  and what they do, if you know, you can even google amaloid beta placks, you'll see they form like these little plaques..  outside of the neurons and this disrupts like glucose metabolism in neurons and app astrocytes it causes even more reactive oxygen species to be generated so now you're generating even more and more on a daily basis and.  the microglia cells, the immune cells of the brain get activated when there's a plaque..  just like the dude when there's a dead cell, they're like, oh my god, what is this? i need to get rid of it..  so they get activated, they secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, they're doing all this firing, firing, and they're trying to eat the plaques..  and so, you know, it causes this vicious cycle of neuroinflammation, where then that causes more plaques to be formed. so you have, it's a terrible, terrible cycle of neuroinflammation..  these amyl waybeta plaques form in fighters and also in like nfl player they've looked at these plaques that are in the brains and they've even shown by like pets again that they form immediately like within hours and this even happens in children that have undergone trauma..  so there's something it's almost like the traumatic brain injury is like accelerated aging..  like it's just, instead of seven decades, boom, it's like it's happening, you know, in an instant, in the course of....  you know, hours, and then it causes this huge cycle of neuroinflammation..  so in addition to that, tau-tangle start to form, this is another thing that happens in response to the activation of these microglios cells in the brain..  where now you've got something like inside your neuron..  you've got a protein called tau and it's really an important protein because basically what it does is it's like.  it's transporting cargo all like a down the long axon to the synaptic cleft where neurotransmission occurs where you form synapses to learn memory those things are happening.  it's transporting lipids, it's transporting glucose, it's transporting mitochondria, that need to get to that synaptic cleft to produce energy..  so it's like it's you know it's transporting all this cargo to get there to do all this really important stuff for your brain to function..  but what happens is traumatic brain injury and also just normal brain aging when you have this activation of the immune system and reactive oxygen species that causes this thing to aggregate..  and it..  screws up its function and now it can't transport any of that cargo. it's like the train became derailed. it can't get there. so now you can't get.  nutrients to the part of the neuron where it needs to get. you can't get mitochondria there, which are making the energy. and so you start to have things breaking down. you start to have synapses dying. that's part of the reason. so two neurons, when you learn something, you form a synapse, a connection between the neurons. and that's the whole purpose of the neurons. they want to form connections without the neurons. and that's what they're there for..  and when you can't do that, if there's not enough energy and it starts breaking down.  the neurons have no purpose. you know, it's like they can't, so they die. and so this causes brain atrophy. and it happens, you know, in normal brain aging over the course of several decades..  where you can look at an alzheimer's brain..  and it's just got massive atrophy. well, the same thing happens with traumatic brain injury. you know, these people are losing a lot of cells, glial cells and neurons in their brain, and it's causing brain atrophy..  so, you know, the accumulation of amyloid beta and tau tangles are two..  prominent features of alzheimer's that are disrupting all sorts of their causing, like i said, immuno-.  nerve inflammation, they're causing a reactive oxygen species to be generated and it causes this cycle where it just won't stop because.  whenever there's an amyl-a-plac, you activate more michael glea. then micro-glia get activated and makes more plaques. so it's this horrible cycle that doesn't get broken..  and not something that's really....  they found both of these things very prominently in in brains of people that i'm undergone tbi. i have a question about repeated trauma. so if you are in a fight, say, and you get hit and hurt, and you get in trouble, but you survive, and then you make it to the next round..  do the impacts that you take after that are they even more devastating because of the initial impact? yes!.  so what happens is because of the initial injury.  your cells and because of the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory response and these things that are happening, that is all a stress to the cell. so the cell is already stressed..  and.  when a cell is stressed..  it is more....  susceptible to death..  um.  this is kind of part of the mechanism by which cancer cells are primed to die in the sense where.  cancer cells are they're stressed because all sorts of you know stuff is going wrong in them and they are primed to die like they the cell is expressing what's called pro apoptotic proteins in them make the cells that are proteins that are you know going to make the cell die.  but the cancer cells found a way to overcome that by expressing these anti-epaptotic proteins. so it's like a balance between, okay, how much do i have that's going to make me die or not make me die? so that's happening when you have a stressed cell from injury and then like for example brain injury..  they're also, you know, the reactive oxygen species causes those cells to make more of those proteins that are saying, okay, die, die, die. so they're already primed to die, even if some of them die immediately, but even the ones that haven't died immediately..  they may not be dead because there is enough of those ones that are saying no don't die yet don't die yet. there's enough of that protein there to sort of balance it out.  but then when you take another stress, boom, it just tips it. it tips it towards death..  so stress plus stress is additive and that stress can sensitize you to death.  stress plus stress will definitely.  caught staff..  so that's something that you know taking you know having repetitive injuries, especially in a short timeframe like that.  sensitizes them to death..  so.  plus, it's also, you know, you're making more of these amyloid beta plaques in your brain. this is like, like i said, it's happening with an hour. so like, the more injury that's happening, the more this....  this is a curling..  so it's really a nasty thing..  with fighters just from watching that one event that i went to..  clear that you know, pretty much all of them were taking injuries to the head..  and so something that.  people may not be aware of when i say people, i mean people in the....  mma community..  is that there's something else that really....  predisposes these fighters to....  new york general of diseases. so there's....  they categorize them as there's different ones like pugilistic dementia and then there's chronic traumatic encephalopathy. and these are all, if you look pathologically, they all share characteristics with alzheimer's disease. they all have these amyloid beta plaques that are accumulated in the brain. they have tau protein aggregating. there's inflammation, mass of atrophy happening because these things cause cell death..  these are all very common and they're shared pathological features in all these neurodegenerative diseases..  i'm not sure..  what exactly if they if they can't call it alzheimer's because alzheimer's is an age related disease so it's like you know calling someone who's 45 and has you know massive.  you know, amyloid plaques in their brain and it's affecting their memory and you know it's affecting their behavior calling that alzheimer's is kind of weird. his alzheimer's just a limiting word do you think that you're when because when you're dealing with the very exact same right?.  situation but.  brought on by trauma.  i don't know. it's hard for me to definitively say that. it's a speculation. i think that looking at, like i said, i think these pugilistic dementia and the chronic traumatic encephalopathy..  it's like alzheimer's but on an accelerated rate and it happened specifically as a consequence to traumatic injury to the head. i've seen it happen.  in a fight. like i've seen a guy be one way and then have a fight and see a noticeably diminished ability to communicate. yes. yeah. that's one of the....  features of lack of.  you know, oxygen to the brain because now you can't have energy..  you know the energy is not being made to.  to facilitate nerd transmission and learning and things in communication. what happens when you have injury?.  is that everything gets diverted to repair..  it's....  you know, energy only makes so much energy..  and, you know, so it's a constant battle, and this is the same for people that are obese, type 2 diabetics, whatever type of chronic injury that's happening in the body..  got inflammation, you know, there's....  there's a lot of energy that's required to repair that injury..  and so it's....  energy gets diverted to repairing that injury and what happens when you have all the energy that the cells are making go to repair well things that are you know normal function don't get it so your metabolism is kind of screwed up you're thinking you know these things are it's it's like a triage almost where you're triaging this to the essential like i need to repair this damage if i don't repair this damage. i might die.  so it's like you shunt the energy to that repair..  process. so things like.  short-term memory, communication, all that sort of gets..  um.  screwed up in a way..  so that makes perfect sense..  i don't know what that would happen. yeah, because i've literally seen guys in, i mean, it's, it's, it's so non-scientific to judge them by the standard because....  you know, it's just my perceptions, but i've seen a guy be one way and then have a couple really brutal fights and then there's a noticeable dimness to the way they look.  the way they talk..  they just, there seems to be like a, like a loss. like, what time frame are we talking about here for this? couple months..  yeah.  wow, so i mean they've they've.  it's been shown that this....  the injury, the acute effects that i was describing in terms of like, you know, the immune, the immune cells in the brain, the microglue getting activated and the amyloid beta plaques forming and all that stuff happens. and they showed that this continues to happen for months, even years later..  even with just a single traumatic brain injury. so one rough fight can potentially affect a person, the negative impacts compound over years. yes, yes, they have shown a dose dependent effect in terms of even multiple mild traumatic injuries. they compound over years and they cause....  pugelistic dementia that cause these types of neurodegenerative diseases that are very, very similar to alzheimer's..  and something.  that i want to point out that may predispose people to them more..  is genetics..  um..  so this is something that's....  very very similar to alzheimer's as well..  so.  we have different variations of genes..  and these are called polymorphisms..  really all appalling morphism is, it's a gene, but it's like....  there's a slight variation in the sequence of dna and that slight variation in the sequence of dna can change the function of that gene somewhat..  um..  i think if we were to really look....  deeply at.  polymorphisms, we'd find there's gotta be a selective reason why we've.  acquired these sort of changes, like there's got to be an advantage. polymorphisms aren't mutations in the sense where a mutation is random..  you know, that just happens. polymorphisms are selected for and they occur in a decent percent of the population..  so.  you know, there seems to be, you can always find, even if the gene changes the gene in the sense where....  it seems like it's not doing something as well as it should be doing..  if we look hard enough, we might find there's actually a reason why there's sort like a trade-off, right?.  so, anyway, so gene polymorphisms, we've got, you know, these are very common ones..  people are always looking at things like the breast cancer related genes, like brca1, brca2 where it's like, oh, if you have a certain variation of this gene, you have a dramatic increase in possibly getting breast cancer..  well, we've got a lot of different variations in genes..  one of them is associated with a dramatic increased risk for alzheimer's disease..  it's an hygiene called apoe and this this gene is.  polymorphic in the sense where there's actually multiple barringons of it, there's three different isoforms of it that are common in the human population..  it's called apo-e 2, apo-e 3, and apo-e 4..  and....  essentially, what we get is a lipoprotein and it's made in the liver and also in the brain. in the liver, what its main function is, it's actually transporting cholesterol, like dietary cholesterol..  and it's making sure it gets to your cells that need it and bringing it back to liver to get recycled. so it plays a very important role in cholesterol transport..  turns out in the brain in our astrocytes, our astrocytes make cholesterol..  we produce apoe in the brain and it plays a very important role in transporting this cholesterol made from astrocytes to neurons..  and it's doing other things also involved with amyloid beta..  but the point is, is that....  there are, like i said, there are three variations. the main one is 8-boe 3, and that's what the majority of population has..  so you get one allele, every gene you have, you get one copy from your mom and you get one copy from your dad so you have two copies of every gene.  and so that's what a leal is..  so most people have two copies of april 3.  which is good because apably 3 is like, it's considered the normal one. like....  but 25% of the population has..  one allele of april 4..  and so, april we four, so 25%, that's one in four people..  just the general population has one of these alleles that they either got from their mom or their dad..  people that have two, so they got one from this, it's much more rare, it's like 2% of the population, actually have two copies of the apoe 4..  so 25% of the population has one copy of april we 4. and what happens is april we 4..  increases the risk of alzheimer's by 2-3-fold..  so people that have aplv4 have an increased risk just two to three-fold. and this is recognizable in the dna test. yes. so you could potentially scan athletes. yes. so..  i'm getting to that. oh, sorry. yeah, so exactly. so people that are fighters or nfl players, people that are any sort of trauma to the brain if they're getting this, you know, as a part of their sports curriculum or whatever..  those people that have one apoe for so traumatic brain injury itself.  increases the risk of alzheimer's by 2-3-fold, just like people that don't have traumatic brain injury but have this 8-bow-wee 4..  people that have tbi and apawe4 increase their risk by like tenfold..  so having just one allele, you have a guy who's getting blows to the head..  and he has an aepawe 4. he's taking his wrist from 2-3-fold to 10-fold..  to get yes and we're talking 25% of the population has this..  so they've shown, they've shown the done studies and they've shown, you know, traumatic brain injury, dramatically increases..  the risk of nerve-genre-de-seize. it's also stroke. people with a stroke and have apoi-fore, you're talking about a 10-fold increased risk of having a nerve-genre-de-seize. so the problem is that you're having apoi-fore..  is you can't repair damage as well..  when you have damage that occurs, there's a lot of apparent mechanisms that can happen. so you can have what's called, like if you lose the synapses that are formed between the two neurons, and then you would beta screws that up..  but you can repair that damage by having like what's called neurite outgrowth so you grow new projections to that neuron..  that's one way to prepare the damage. and apoe plays a very important role in that because it brings cholesterol and fatty acids to the neuron, the membrane. and that's really important to be able to grow new synopsis. you need that. apoe4 doesn't do that as well. and also, not only does apoe4 not do that as well, but it's a great way to do that..  there's also bad effects, aprilie for itself..  is it's....  the polymorphism that happens, it changes the structure of it and so it's like getting degraded a lot so you don't have enough of apoe around and it chops it up and starts aggregating and doing bad stuff itself.  so it's like it's just terrible because what happens when you have tbi when you have an injury the brain actually increases apoe because it's like oh, i got to repair some of this damage but if you have that apoe for it's increasing the bad part. it's increasing, you know the bad stuff so you can actually test for.  this variant using 23andme for example. so i actually recently did a 23andme test. it's $99..  and you spit in like a little tube..  and you send it off and to the 23 of me and they isolate dna from your saliva and then they look for very common polymorphism so they look for apoi, they look for parkinson's related ones and cancer and all that so.  unfortunately, the fda shut down part of their ability to....  inform you whether or not you have. yeah, so that happened recently. i think it was sort of a consequence to angelina jolie..  getting your boobs cut off. oh my god..  yeah, so was that misinformed what she did?.  so, unfortunately, i haven't really read exactly..  how everything went down, i just know that she did 23 of me and you know found out she had some, she had a polymorphism in one of the genes. but she didn't have cancer..  no, no..  so yeah, so that's a part i think that sort of precipitated the fda.  so, the way they test for these genes is by some people called pcr and it's not infallible. so, they can give you back your results and say, oh look, you've got this polymorphism associated with x and disease which increases your risk for cancer by 10-fold..  and it could have just been a little error in the method. so, you know, it's not like a foolproof technique..  and i think that's also part of the problem where it's like you're giving people back this genetic data and it's like they're taking it very seriously and obviously taking going to extreme measures to do things, you know, like getting their boobs removed..  but you still can. 23 enemies not shut down. like i did it when they were already unable to give you....  tell you exactly what polymorphisms you have. well, i'm a scientist, so i didn't really care because they give you the raw data..  and i can actually go through the raw data, which i did, and see what polymorphisms i have..  and i found out that i actually have one allele of apoe4..  so, and it was so funny because it's really the only gene i cared about, like all the other stuff, like i did 23 in me because i was terrified..  of having april 4..  and so i have it and it turns out my dad gave it to me and my dad has it..  so, you know....  like i said, having 8.5 per week for just 1 allele of it is already you have a 2-3 full increase risk for alzheimer's. if you look at people with alzheimer's between 65 and 80 percent of them have 1 allele of 8.5 per week for..  so basically any person walking around with one allele has about a 30% risk of getting alzheimer's..  and it really really has to do with.  your environment the way you interact with your environment that..  that's going to shift you either into getting it or not..  and think in what way..  multiple ways.  so....  you know the.  that.  the apoe4 is, like i said, it's not working well. and one of the ways, so ammoid beta plaques building up in the brain, whether you're talking about an exponential rate because of injury, traumatic injury to the brain, we're talking about just normal brain aging, decades and decades and decades..  there's apoe plays an important role in taking that amelwood beta that's built up and.  bringing it to get degraded it like gets rid of it.  but if you have apwe4, it's just for some reason can't bind to the a-bata plaque as well, and so it can't remove it..  so you're talking about people that are not only accumulating more of it because, you know....  of other things that apoe for is doing, but they can't remove it as well..  so, you know, people that have two april e3s, they've got a better, you know, mechanism of removing that amyloid beta..  well, there's another way you can remove amyloid beta from the brain and that's from getting sleep, literally..  sleep when you sleep. what happens is.  your brain actually swells..  because cerebral spinal fluid gets pushed up into the brain. you have this whole.  glymphatic system, like, you know, lymph vessels and things that are surrounding neurons and astrocytes and cerebral spinal fluid gets pushed into the brain when you sleep..  and it literally physically..  pushes out amoloid beta plaques. it removes amoloid beta plaques..  and other.  dead debris, things like that, just trash that's building up in the brain..  um..  and this is happening when you sleep..  so....  if you don't sleep, if you're not getting enough sleep....  then you know people have this 8.3 that's another way they can clear it out of the brain, but me.  i really need to make sure i get enough sleep because.  i don't have that other repair mechanism to get rid of the amyloid beta plaques..  has there been shown that anything else does it? meditation? anything on those lines? in terms of the glenphatic system, i don't... i think that, you know, that seems to be a unique....  featured asleep something that's happening when.  especially when you're in rem sleep..  um..  but you know why it's it's.  rem sleep is triggering it..  yeah, no, you know, this is a new relatively new finding and i think we're gonna news in this decade. oh, yeah, like new as in just a couple of years ago so it's so fascinating. it's something so significant important is 2012 right, it's you know, well there's.  the human brain is very complicated and there's lots of little people that are doing research that are looking at just a tiny aspect of this. because there's so many little....  details that you have to sort of interrogate to figure things out and how they're working..  but the glyphatic system is something that's really cool because it gives a....  a mechanistic explanation as to why another reason why sleep is so important. now does nutrition play any part in your brain's ability to do this or to mitigate this issue?.  yeah, so there's i mean.  nutrition plays a huge factor. if you look at people....  that are obese..  you know, end-or insulin resistant, type 2 diabetic..  these.  people also have an increased risk for alzheimer's disease..  they have increased risk for a lot of age-related disease. it's like they're accelerating their age and process in general..  um.  but.  the fact that they also have an increase for alzheimer's disease parkinson's is very, you know, it's interesting because it suggests, you know, something about..  not having the right diet..  is also involved and.  there's multiple things going on here and you know, i can't.  figure all of them out, but you know part part of the reason is they've shown that.  so obesity, you've got chronic inflammation going on, also with type 2 diabetics, and that inflammation actually causes this accretion of like..  pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are, you know, they activate the immune system..  you know, because that's what happens when the body is like, wait, something's here that's not supposed to be, get rid of it and....  this is the same thing that happens in the brain that causes the amyloid beta plaques to start getting build up..  well, those things cross over the blood brain barrier..  inflammatory cytokines, crossover get into the brain and start causing neuro-inflammation..  so, it's really like, they've even shown like if you inject..  you can inject people with endotoxin. endotoxin is what's like a part of the bacterial cell wall it's released..  you know when bacteria are dying and it happens in the gut a lot..  but it causes massive inflammation. you can inject people with endotoxin and it causes learning and memory deficits..  and it causes depressive symptoms..  also, you can inject them with a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon and.  that interferon also causes depressive symptoms..  because inflammation is being more and more linked to depression as well. but also inflammation in the brain is causing the aggregation of these amyloid beta plaques..  to occur..  so that's very interesting how literally inflammation in your body, in your gut, in the peripheral part of your body can affect your brain. well, there's a lot of things that happen. there have been, started in reptugin, but having there been some recent studies that have shown that....  the gut bacteria of kids that have alzheimer's..  is usually an issue..  that a lot of children that have alzheimer's also have issues with gut bacteria like they do. you mean autism? what did i say? alzheimer's. i'm sorry, yeah, autism. yeah. i was really in it and all i'm saying. literally..  words are coming out. maybe i've been hitting the head too many times. but yeah, autism spectrum disorders and even asperger's that there's been some sort of a connection to gut bacteria. yeah, yeah, definitely. i mean these people with autism do have a lot of inflammation in their gut.  and having inflammation in your gut, what's going to happen? it's going to get into your brain and it's going to cause your own inflammation in your brain..  and another thing that inflammation in the brain does is.  is it activates the....  you've got prostaglandins that are being generated specifically e2 series prostaglandins..  and the reason why that's bad in the brain is because generating e2 series prostaglandins..  in habits?.  the brain's ability to release serotonin. so you basically....  can't release serotonin from like a priest and optic neuron, which is important. you want to, you need to release serotonin. you know, serotonin is doing a lot of things in addition to regulating mood. it's regulating behavior, regulating impulsive behavior, things like that. social behavior. but you know, this....  inflammation that gets into the brain literally.  stops their tone in from being released from the brain by inhibiting this this sorry by activating the e2 series and even been shown like.  that study i was talking about, people were they injected a pro and inflammatory cytokine?.  and they came down with depressive symptoms..  if they gave those people epa, like a very high dose of epa,.  so, i co-supentate you know a gastro, which is one of the omega-3s..  that mitigated the depressive symptoms like they didn't get the depressive symptoms..  because i think that what's happening is that inflammation is causing one thing that epa does very potent, potently, is inhibits the generation of e2 series pro-saglandins. so in that way gut bacteria especially taking in the form of probiotics is probably a very important part of them..  the human diet that is widely ignored by a lot of people, right?.  yeah, i said dohylis you're drinking kombucha here. i love my kombucha no, but i said to you that this is the kombucha that's watered down so that it meets the whole food standards yeah, no, i had no idea. yeah, did you get this at whole foods? i got it. yeah yeah, well the one up the street they have the regular stuff too you got to know what bottled to get and you need to have a license like a driver's license it shows you're over 21.  but it's only one half of one percent that's the cutoff. if it's more than one half of one percent alcohol by volume, then you have to have a liquor license to sell it, which is preposterous. you can't get drunk off of it. no, i had no idea that this was watered down. but, you know, yes, probiotics are....  very important..  so probiotics are doing things like generating lactic acid, which does a lot of things. one is it's....  killing off these pathogenic bacteria that....  can't live in an inocytic environment in the gut..  but also like i mentioned lactate..  lactates also can be used by mitochondria. so you're talking about....  giving a source of energy for your mitochondria, you know, so that you can.  so.  an important component of not having a lot of gut inflammation..  is yes the balance between probiotics and the pathogenic bacteria, but it's also maintaining that gut barrier because you've got a lot of immune cells in your gut. you know, they're there because....  you don't want to eat something bad and you know, it kill you..  so they're there and they're ready to, you know..  fight off anything that's potentially pathogenic..  so they have a purpose of being there..  the way they don't continually start fighting off things is because there's a barrier, which is basically a mucus..  it's called mucin, and your gut cells secrete it. this mucin is important for separating the immune cells in your gut from the bacteria, because when that mucin gets broken down, then your immune cells are exposed to bacteria, which are supposed to be in your gut. they're like, oh, bacteria, and they start firing all these cytokines, and you start to get inflammation, which then breaks down the gut very or more, and it causes the same sort of cycle that i was talking about in the brain. this sort of cycle is going on, and it can happen in the gut as well..  so, things like eating a lot of sugar..  you know, like literally like....  break down the mucus in..  so it's like having that chronic inflammation is....  doing a lot of things. so having the right balance of bacteria is one thing that's good, but also making sure that you're eating the right.  diet to make sure that you're giving your cells the right energy they need to do things that they're supposed to do. if we're talking about the gut making mu sen. and sugar actually fuels bad bacteria in the gut as well, right? yeah, sugar does fuel bad bacteria in the gut. so a lot of the bad bacteria in the gut like to....  get them some sugar. so then you're talking about having overgrowth of the bad bacteria..  so there's a lot of... the weekends your immune system? yes. shutter is a significant immune system weekening agent. got information in general. i think that also has a lot to do with....  if you think about....  having a breakdown of the gut barrier and all this pathogenic bacteria which also break down the gut, like that's what they do also..  a lot of energy gets spent towards fixing that..  fixing that oh my god. i got a fix that i got to repair this and that takes away from brain function and that takes away from cognitive and immunity and immune function because now, you know you're all the energies going towards the gut to repair this chronic damage. it's also happening.  and now your immune systems don't, you know, when you're fighting off a disease, when you're fighting off a pathogenic, you know, whether it's viral or bacterial or whatever, like that requires a massive amount of energy..  massive amount of energy. that's an energy consuming process..  so it's a matter of triaging this energy to the right place. it's like okay well.  you know, if my gut's really healthy, i'm not inflamed, i have a good diet, i'm getting my microtranet, i'm not eating a bunch of sugary crap, you know, refined carbohydrates and things like that..  then you don't have all this chronic damage happening that your energy is constantly, it's like a drain, an energy drain, it just keeps getting sucked into it. and that affects all sorts of other functions in the body..  so....  and there's other explanations, but i like to think about it that way in terms of like a triaging of energy because....  it really just makes a lot of sense, you know, from an energetic standpoint looking at..  how energetically consuming..  fighting off diseases and how energetically consuming repair is and people that are obese or type-2 diabetic they're in a constant repair state..  constant. so it's a lot of it is poor energy management because of your diet. because of your diet your energy is being taken away to a bunch of functions that you wouldn't order it ordinarily. need for if your diet was good. exactly. exactly. like it's really interesting the lab that i that i work in at children's hospital in oakland..  we work with a lot of insulin-resistant ob's children. we are also doing research on adolescents and even some of the parents of these children, which are also ob's and insulin-resistant..  and.  some of my colleagues in my lab have developed a like a nutrient bar they call it the cory bar..  and the nutrient, it's like a micro nutrient dense bar where it has all sorts of vitamins and minerals and vitamin d and fiber, has some polyphenols, it has dha, it has just a bunch of good stuff..  instead of taking a bunch of vitamins, it's all in like a matrix with fiber and stuff so that things are absorbed better and digested..  and um.  you know, my colleagues, i haven't been directly involved in this research because i look more at things like dna damage, but what my colleagues have found is that giving these obese people, whether we're talking about children or, you know, out of lessons adult..  giving them this micronutrient bar..  if you compare giving it to a lean person and you don't have them change their diet at all, it's like....  you know, do what you're gonna do, eat, eat what you're gonna eat, but here take this twice a day on top of that..  what we find is that one publication that was done on lean people, lean people like immediately..  their hdl goes up, you know, things start happening, they make more glutathione, like all these positive changes occur..  but obese people, it takes a lot longer to happen. it takes a couple of weeks, whereas it actually takes even more than that..  i don't remember the exact amount of time, but it takes longer to happen. we think it takes longer because these people, first all that energy, that, you know, the stuff, the micronutrients, all these things..  it's being shunted towards fixing. and eventually, as they start to fix....  then you start to see little changes happening, but it doesn't happen right away. it happens in people that are healthy, and i use lean as a marker for healthy. i mean, it's not entirely accurate, but....  generally speaking, we're not healthier than obese. exactly, relatively speaking. clute thion. do you take glutathione as a supplement?.  no, so that actually, you know, i wanted to talk about....  some of the possible, you know, tbi, we're talking about traumatic brain injury and i talk about all this terrible stuff but there are things that can be done to help.  and you know, glutathione is interesting because so glutathione is its....  one of the major antioxidants in the brain..  which is why it's very important..  you know, as....  for brain aging in general and it's all, it's been associated with a lot of studies in terms of.  more glutathione in the brain, you know, decrease alzheimer's, decrease damage in the brain going on..  glutathione is just basically three amino acids that are together..  and it's glutamic acid, glycine, and i think cysteine..  so.  our body makes this inside of our cells. we make it, we have an enzyme called glutathione synthase and that enzyme takes those amino acids and puts it together..  and then once we have glutathione, we have other enzymes that are able to use glutathione as a potent antioxidant..  cludothione peroxidase, for example. this is another enzyme that uses that cludothione..  to prevent that reactive oxygen species damage i was talking about that happens like one of the early events.  with traumatic brain injury. and it's also one of the early damaging events that happens just with normal brain aging..  which is happening all the time. we're making it right now in our brains..  so having glutathione in the brain is really good and there's different enzymes that use it. so glutathione proxies will use glutathione..  to basically reduce that oxidative damage so it can't..  damage the neuron or the astrocyte or whatever, you know, cell type that it comes in contact with..  the problem is that with age.  we decrease the expression of glutathione related genes and that means is you know.  you have genes in your body and sometimes they can be..  expression just means you make more of it so when it's being expressed you're making more of it so that's a good thing.  um..  as we age, we decrease the expression. so like everything, things fall apart, and we don't make as much of these glutathione-related genes..  the same with glutathione as you can't because it's made in our cells..  there's no transport mechanism to get glutathione into the cell..  you know, you can transport in amino acids and the amino acids and you know, this glutathione synthase uses those to make it in the cell. but there's no transport mechanism for glutamic acid glycine, cysteine, like together to get in..  and you know, you can't just, you cells have, you know, transport mechanisms to get stuff inside. it's a regulated process..  so take and go to thion..  orally is sort of....  pointless, not to mention the fact that.  the guy isn't gonna absorb it either, it gets broken apart..  there is....  light pissomal, quit a thiam. that's what i'd take..  take that morning. yeah, so liposomal good to thion anything that's liposomal can.  bypass a lot of these transport mechanisms just based on.  first of all, liposomes can be absorbed by the gut, but also they can get into cells because a liposome is basically like....  you know, it's like a little lipid that has a phospholipid bilayer and it has whatever it has inside of it, in this case, glutathione, which is soluble, and it fuses with the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and basically just gets taken up. so then whatever's inside of it goes into the cell..  and.  they've shown, and i've looked for studies to see..  you know, liposomal, supplemental liposomal, glutathione, like, how might, like, is it getting into tissue? is it getting into the brain, for example? because it's important..  and i haven't found a lot of studies. i found one study that showed in rabbits that were given oral liposomal glutathione. we're able to increase..  the glutathione levels in their brain, in their heart, and also in the liver, but they were given a massive dose. they were given 400 milligrams, and they're about 11 pounds. so that's like six grams for like 180 pound man. so what is 400 milligrams? like what is that, like in a physical form? like what would you see?.  is it would it be how many teaspoons would that pay for a row?.  i don't know. i mean you'd have to look at i think if it's in a teaspoon like it tells you the like milligram content per teaspoon i did look up online to see because i was like i gotta get me some of this and um.  that.  the problem is that most of the glyphosomal glutathione is really expensive and it's like between 100 milligrams and 400 milligrams per dose like per teaspoon or per capsule what they gave to a rabbit they gave right a lot but a rabbit weighs 11 pounds the rabbit swallows it to aren't you supposed to hold it in your mouth under your tongue? no, they they inject like they give it to the.  to the rabbit like they inject it in their mouth. yeah..  but the way i've been told to take the liposome glutehthyon is to tuck it under your tongue. you're squirt it under your tongue, hold it in your mouth for 30 seconds and then swallow it. does that make any sense at all? no, i have no idea how that would do, but the point. the idea being... oh, sorry, good. no, i mean, the point is that you supplement like liposome glutehthyon may be actually... you may be getting it into your brain..  it's just a matter of how much, you know, is it? they didn't do a dose response in that study and....  if it wasn't so darn expensive, there's other ways to increase glutathione, but here's the thing..  taking supplemental glutathione in the form of liposomal glutathione, of course, any other supplemental glutathione is for.  it's useful. yeah, it's useful. okay. so pill form nothing. well, i think they have liposome. you can have it in pill form with liposome. yeah..  but it just has to be like pizomal is the point. yeah, if it's not like pizomal then you're not even getting it past the gut. let alone into the cell. so, but....  the other thing is is that okay, so here's the thing..  you supply yourself with....  this liposoma glutathione, but the thing is is that the enzyme that uses glutathione, glutathione peroxide is in these other enzymes, they decrease with age. so while you're bypassing the, you know,.  the decrease in the expression of glutathane synthase..  which is what makes krutthion..  you're not bypassing the decrease in expression of this enzyme that uses it. that's using glutathione to do its thing..  so that's also important..  and there's other ways that you can actually increase glutathione, but just interestingly, i came across a study recently, like 2014, very like, i think it was even just a couple months ago..  it was a traumatic brain injury study where they had basically took mice and they....  induced traumatic brain injury by like putting pressure on their brain..  and what happens is they notice that..  i mean, the blood brain barrier was compromised all those things that i was talking about happens..  water's flowing into the brain and saw you to know that and activation of immune function, all that's sub-taping. what they found was that if they put glutathione, they actually, because they did a pressure, mouse skulls are much thinner than human skulls are. and if they did a pressure rune to the mouse skull, there was like a little tiny crack in this skull..  and they could put glue to thion on top, topically..  where the crack is and it would get through into the brain..  and what they found was that if they did it within three hours of the injury, they abrogated like 70% of the cell death that happens..  amazing, but it was a three hour time window. can that be done to humans?.  so i was wondering, well, so the thing, that's what got me on this whole amazon trail. i was like, well, we can't, first of all, we don't even know anything about the human school. i mean, we know about it, but we don't know whether or not you can put something topically after a traumatic injury and if it's going to get in, they're doing those studies now, because this was actually a new discovery where it's like, oh, wow, you can actually get through the school and get into the, at least under an injuries type situation. so the idea would be that you would inject something into the skin on the scalp..  um....  i don't think he injected it but yeah, go under the skin like this right right go under neol, but whether or not that can be done in humans i don't know like i said i mean first of all humans have a much thicker school than then some rodents right but um so they're you know gonna be testing that but the other thing is is like okay well can you.  the key part of this study in my mind was they inhibited that reactive oxygen species, which is the instigator of this whole cascade, this neuroinflammatory. if they went downstream and tried to inhibit inflammation, it didn't have the effect because those things were already activated. you already had cell dead cells because it's the reactive oxygen species starting in and causing the cell death. and that was how they were able to prevent, like 70% of the cell death by giving that topical visit done..  so, that was like, wow, well, we got to figure out how to do that. yeah, exactly. and so, there's other ways you can increase glytothione. the liposomal is one. i don't know how....  robust like i said with that one studying rabbits massive amount we're talking about like for an 180 pound man and i don't even know how much some of these mma fighters weigh they probably weigh more than that but.  180 pound man, you're talking about 6 grams of liposomal, good or thiant, which is a lot. significant amount. i mean, considering how costly it is, it's just not economically feasible in my mind. right. the holding it under the tongue, i've seen liposomal b12 that's used in a similar way, makes sense. b12 people, it's sublingual, people do that to bypass the whole stomach acid thing,.  you know, i don't know. maybe there's something i just don't know about with the liposome liquidethyone. subling will means what does that actually mean? it means holding it under the tongue yeah, it's the distribution method. yeah, right.  so to use liposol and use it in a sublingual way to just tuck it under. does that make any sense? would it go into your blood?.  that way. um....  i mean, i don't know why it would be any different than swallowing it, but....  don't waste my time, i could just be not thinking about something that's obvious to me or.  or it's just a waste of time. have there been studies on that? liposomal b12 taken sublingually?.  i haven't really read any there may have been studies on that, but i haven't looked in the literature of that. well, look at it right now. yeah, so the other ways to increase....  so like i mentioned, so there's there's genes that are glutathione related genes, so you can increase the expression of those genes. right away, sublingmal liposol glutathione shows up in the first thing that you....  you google, if you google.  sublingual liposomal glutathione is the first thing that pops up in google before yeah.  yeah.  well, that's something i can certainly..  read about but i just off the top of my head..  can't think of why that would be more effective at getting into your cells. it's saying right here the only way to get significant amounts into your body is with liposomal glutathione supplements..  either iv or injection is the other way..  yeah..  yeah, injections another way..  and that obviously bypasses the whole intestinal absorption thing..  so what's interesting is they've done so other ways to increase glutathione would be for example tomeric turmeric. yeah, i use that stuff. yeah, it's all well. they've shown so there's two different bioactive components in it one is the curcumin.  and that has what that does. curcumin is, first of all, it's awesome. it gets into the brain and it's, you know, it has antioxidant activity itself, aside from glutathione, but it also increases.  the expression of all the good, author-related genes..  so it turns on glutathione peroxidase, glutathione synthase, and another gene called glutathione reductase, which actually recycles glutathione that's already been used or oxidized, which is really cool. because now you're talking about ramping up the whole glutathione system like all of it..  and so they've done studies in mice where they've done tbi related studies for traumatic brain injury, where they've given them, they did intravenous..  and because of the.  the effects of you know you basically metabolize curcumin immediately. it's like.  40 minutes to one hour. do you say curcumin or sircumin? i always say curcumin. yeah, i know i've said it wrong. what do you usually say? sircumin.  oh, no, i think it's curcumin. i just read it and try to pronounce it. i'm not actually talking about it. i know. oh, really? i haven't been able to say it. wow. it's a miracle i've heard, but it's the actual... tirmaryk..  to merck..  tomer, tomer. i think there's an r-t-u-r-tomeric..  yeah. but, uh, whatever. i know what it is, but it's not important. it's like a spice. you know, it's good stuff. yeah, it's like curries, you know, people using their curries, but it's like. massive anti-inflammatory. massive anti-inflammatory. massive anti-inflammatory. it inhibits like the activation of nfcapab, which is like this gene that like turns on a whole variety of different genes involved in inflammation. so it's like, belunting the whole inflammatory cascade. and it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you.  and it activates all the glutathione genes. and on top of that, it has an antioxidant activity itself. so it's like a triple whammy, so it's really cool. so curcumin is probably way better than taking liposomal glutathione? well, i don't know because... maybe it's in synergistic....  certainly synergistic, but the thing with curcumin is that it is also rapidly metabolized because it's a xenobiotic, which means it's not a vitamin or a mineral, it's something foreign to the body. polyphenols, egcgs from green tea, all these things are the same, a lot of herbal echinacea. these are what are called xenobiotics. and what happens when you take a xenobiotic?.  is it activates this whole pathway in the liver, which is like, you know, the liver is like, oh, there's this foreign thing in my body, that's not supposed to be here, it's not a vitamin, it's not a mineral, okay, i need to get rid of it. so it metabolizes, it detoxifying, whatever. so it gets metabolized rapidly..  but there's something in black pepper..  called pepper ring, that inhibit xenobiotic metabolism..  so, it's been shown in humans that if you give....  the pumping.  piperine that you can increase the bioavailability of curcumin by 2000% in humans. whoa. which is pretty significant. so that's kind of cool because i'm like, oh, well, of course i ordered some curcumin with piperine and to for myself because i've got, you know, apoi-4 and it's just a really good thing. but with traumatic brain injury, they've shown that, you know, if they give it to mice to do it intravenously and they give them like a really high dose..  it prevents the whole inflammatory response to the edema, intercranial pressure, all that stuff is dramatically improved. and this is again, it's like a time window where it was like....  you know, a few hours after the trauma. after the trauma. so it's, you know, but i think maybe even before, if you're already, if you're already having in your system, you know..  the question is how much is it going to like....  you know, prevent the acute, you know, immediate thing. i don't know to what degree, but at least at the very least, taking it every day..  you're talking about....  inhibiting some of that neuroinflammatory cycle..  that cycle that's really vicious because once you have the plaques form which happens within hours in after injury then you're talking about you know it activating the whole cycle where it causes more and more years and years and years and years so there's no negative repercussions to take me. there's nothing yeah, so in that study where they increased the bioavailability by 2,000 percent there was no adverse side effects.  however, since piperine inhibits zoonobiotic metabolism.  full force. it's inhibiting this very generalized pathway that's used to detoxify and get all sorts of foreign things, even drugs, antibiotics..  whatever your stand, whatever you take..  so....  there is a concern like in my mind. i haven't done a lot of reading on this, you know to see what's out there in literature but.  just from you know my understanding of the mechanism. i think it's you don't want to go crazy because it's like if you're taking a bunch of other stuff because it's going to increase the the half life of.  all sorts of, you know, other xenobiotics, which are just, you know, like i said, a lot of different herbal things or....  you know, things like kirk cumin and agcg's all that stuff. so....  there's always that potential. it's like, well, what else are you taking? are you increasing the half-life of that too by taking this, you know, piperine with it? and then what is that doing?.  so that's it you should definitely be cautious in that in that respect. so don't take too much of it but yeah, i haven't seen too much of it like i you know when i did some searching for like the to merit but the thing is is that i like the to merit and not just the curcumin because there's another compound.  you know, that's in turmeric called tumerone, aromatic tumerone..  and i studied just came out like a couple of months ago on this where it's actually, it does, it does a lot of the same things that the curcumin does and that it inhibits inflammation..  but it does something in addition to that. it actually repairs bring damage because it....  causes the proliferation of neural stem cells in your brain. so i know it's like, and it was very robust. there's two regions of the brain that you can actually....  you have neural stem cells, which means you can make new neurons..  you've damaged neurons, neurons have died. you want to replace those neurons. there's two regions of the brain that can do that. the subventricular zone and the dentate gyros..  and so, tumarone actually causes the proliferation of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone..  and to some degree, when they were giving these mice, i can't recall if the top of my head had the dose, but they were giving them pretty high dose..  and what they found was that it increased the proliferation of them by leg..  you know, 60%..  which is pretty significant..  part of the problem with age is that.  these neural stem cells..  they start to proliferate less..  and as they start to proliferate less, then you have less of them being made and you also have less..  new neurons being made to less nerve genesis. so if you think about in the context of someone who's undergone a traumatic brain injury, they've undergone, they've had massive amounts of cell death occurring from that reactive oxygen species, from that inflammation..  you know they've lost neurons that's that's that's a fact.  so if you can have something that's boosting the proliferation of their neural stem cells..  that's a great thing. it's not just a great thing for people that have had an injury. it's a great thing for just normal brain aging. i think it's also a great thing for people that are susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases like myself..  because i have one of these apawee 4 alleles, you know. so i'm....  i've got to be really careful because i can't repair damage as well if i can make sure i grow new neurons..  then you know that's that's a good thing. i didn't know there was anything that you could eat that could help grow new neurons i'd never heard of that. yeah, so tomorrow is stimulates stimulates the proliferation of.  the neuro stem cells in the sub ventricular zone. this study was really came out like less than two months ago. that's incredible. it's pretty incredible. yeah, i'm so you can get smarter for meeting to learn. they did get smarter. yeah, they had improvements. now, i mean, take this with the grain of salt in the sense where it's like the whole bioavailability thing in humans and how much are we?.  that's always the issue. it's like, okay, well, they're giving them out a much higher dose. so that it's like, first of all, they're injecting it in some cases. so it's bypassing the whole getting absorbed..  but the fact that it occurs is hopeful because it's like, well, eventually we'll find a way to overcome some of the bioavailability issues, which, you know, we kind of are. so is the bioavailability issue mitigated at all by a large dose? so like, if you're taking, like, what do you recommend as a dose? like a thousand milligram pills or what i have of a termaric? well, in the case of the mouse studies, it's mitigated by a large dose that's given intravenously, so... so i need to start shooting. so you don't have... how do you shoot up to america? yeah, you know....  i don't know. and the question is they've got a suppository. they have clinical trials that they're doing now with people, with alzheimer's or people that have dementia, early dementia signs. they're doing this with turmeric. i hope they use piperine also. are they using suppositories? they're just... i don't know. i don't know what they're using because a lot of studies have come out recently in a different model organisms where they've looked like at worms, and flies, and mice, and they've all these different neurodegenerative models where they look and study this stuff, and they find....  hands down this turmeric..  is doing some cool shit like it's awesome and these studies are the administering it orally or they're using injectables if you're talking about mice then there are a lot of them have been injectables and this is where the studies are coming out yes studies aren't on humans yet.  i mean, but they did get smarter the people that they did it to that got smarter they did.  so the people, no, those were mice. those were mice gets murdered? the mouse performed better on learning and memory. oh, yes, yes, yes. so, but..  let's see, what was the other, there was another um....  interesting thing about the, oh i know i went what i wanted to bring up. it was, i got sort of sidetracked when i was talking about the neural stem cells that are in the sub ventricular zone..  what's really interesting about this is that they um....  they readily go to the olfactory bulb..  you know, smell so there.  sensitive smell is a good predictor of alzheimer's disease, in parkinson's disease, and even just all cause mortality. like, literally, you can have decreased sensitive smell, and, you know, it can be a good predictor of your next, you know..  five-year mortality..  and it was like, why is this dense of smell?.  you're such a good predictor of people that are going to get alzheimer's soon. also people that may just die soon. and we're finding out again just recently within the past couple of months that the olfactory bulb requires a constant supply of neural stem cells because the olfactory neurons, which are in your olfactory bulb, which is just right in front of your brain..  those neurons which are responsible for smelling things, you know, they send signals to the brain so that you can you know experience it so to speak.  they require a constant supply of stenoral stem cells, which is coming from the sub-bentricular zone..  and so....  when you start to have that process diminished where you can't.  supply those new stem cells to the well factory above your sense of smell goes away and so that's why also it's a predictor of alzheimer's because you're literally losing the bill no, don't people are born with people are born with a terrible sense of smell that doesn't mean that you don't that you're like not making neural stem cells so the release don't freak out like there's other reasons why you cannot have a good sense of smell the reason this is impacting me right now is because i know people who've been knocked out and lost their sense of smell yeah, so wow yeah, so that's um the the the tramero and that was given to these mice that improved their sense of smell and improved you know that.  this is, there's another thing also with this neuro stem cell..  i've known for some time that this sense of smell is.  a good predictor of alzheimer's..  but in just until i had, i just didn't understand why and this whole understanding the neuro stem cells being having to replace it like constantly. so it's literally like like marker. it's like a marker for brain. you know, your brain ability to repair damage in your brain..  um..  i remember last time i was on the podcast you mentioned that study where they gave young blood to old mice and they essentially made them. yeah, again. well, i'm going to bring this back to the nose. so..  i became very interested in that study and....  so essentially....  what they found is that there's something in the blood that's secreted. so it's in the plasma actually, and it's called growth differentiation factor 11..  and it....  it's made more readily in young blood..  so it decreases with age like everything does. and what happens is this growth differentiation factor 11..  goes to the brain, goes to the muscle, and it stimulates stem cell proliferation, and it does it in the sub-ventricular zone. and so when they did it mice, what they found was that the mice, you know, their tissues were less aged. the only way you can reverse tissue aging in that to that degree,.  has got to be related to stem cells. because when you already have all this damage, like the only way you're going to repair that damage is by replacing and replenishing that population with new cells. and because as we age, the ability to do that, our stem cell ability, proliferation decreases and all that stuff decreases, we can't do it as well..  and also the more reactive oxygen species we get the more those cells start dying..  so....  the fact that you know these....  uh....  tissues were able to reverse an aging was really obviously indicative stem cells when they found was indeed this growth differentiation factors in the plasma.  it's more of its young people and it's causing the proliferation of neural stem cells in the sub-intericular zone and also in muscle..  what they found was they could even isolate that growth differentiation factor and inject it into old mice and you would have the same effect, which is really cool because that gives....  hope for isolating it and for, you know, basically people using it as a source to it..  stimulate proliferation of stem cells..  and there's actually a clinical trial that started this month at stanford where they're injecting plasma from young individuals that are younger than 30..  and they're giving them to people with mild alzheimer's, older people with mild alzheimer's and they're going to check though..  the cognitive effects immediately after and also long-term..  so, but the whole stem cell thing in the nose and it's very....  interesting how it's like the nose..  that stem cell, you know, neural stem cell..  capacity to make more of them can be, you know..  you can see the status of that by your sense of smell. and the fact that you've....  you know observed fighters that have had decreased census now that is alarming. well there's one guy named gary goodrich who's a real veteran mixed martial arts fighter who was around during the early days of the ufc and he fought it..  k1, he fought in pride, he's like kind of a legendary mixed martial arts character..  and he's dealing with some pretty significant traumatic brain injury now from years and years of fighting and.  that's one of the issues that he had. he lost a sense of smell and that makes total sense what you're saying. yep..  i'm sorry to hear that, you know, i....  all right, like i said, the....  the api-we-four thing is something i think is really, really significant and i think that....  yeah, they've shown it with....  traumatic brain injury from car accidents. they've shown it with strokes. they've shown it in boxers..  you know that having one of those alleles you're talking about a tenfold increase risk of screwing up your brain. do you think that that's something that they should scream for when they give someone a license to fight? i think that if i want to fight her..  i would want to know. i would know my risk. and you're completely missing the psychology of a fighter. fighters feel invulnerable..  like the idea of a fighter is that everybody else is gonna get fucked up but not me.  i'm gonna be different..  i'm going to rise above. i have a championship's heart, a champion's heart, champion's mindset. i'm going to get through things that other people can't endure..  you're not going to if you have an apoi for a little you're not yeah, you're you're bringing science into the world of fighting. yes, i i would love.  so that's it happened because you're talking about possibly changing the lives of like, you know.  25% of fighters fighters would still want to fight.  i guarantee you a good majority of them would still want to fight and they would just say, well, cross out bridge when i come to it. well, if i start feeling the difference, but the real issue is once you start feeling the issues, you've only touched the tip of the iceberg of the amount of damage that you've actually acquired. yes. yes. and once you start becoming symptomatic in the sense where....  your memory. short-term memory becomes affected. like what we were talking about with denny and our friend. right. that is....  typical of, you know, a 80-year-old human being that has acquired 80 years of inflammatory reactivoxin species damage in the brain, you know, then you start to see those symptoms. do you remember there was a story a few years back of a football player?.  do you remember the football player that fell off the truck jamie? he jumped henry chris henry that's it. he was involved in some sort of a dispute with his girlfriend or his wife.  forget which one and she took off with his truck and he chased her and jumped on the back of the truck and fell.  and fell off the truck while she's speeding on the road, cracked his head open, died..  they did a autopsy on him and found out that he had the brain of a 70-something-year-old alzheimer's patient. and he was in his 20s..  wasn't yeah yeah find out how old he was i'm i want to say he was 28 years old.  and he had me this is.  the guy who would not express any issues as far as like.  there's a bunch of different athletes now that are coming out and there's been an hbo real sports piece that they just did this past weekend that i watched about football players and violent expression that they're directly relating to this traumatic brain or that they're suffering from football..  but this young man twice.  26, 26 and he had, see if you could find the article about him having, did it, does it say he had?.  about his brain issue. there was an article where they did the autopsy on it. research just find brain trauma in henry. 26 years old..  there's chronic melodic, and,.  i can't say that. and cephalopathy. and cephalopathy. yeah..  yes, so this is well there's multiple things that you brought up that is.  that we should discuss. i think, you know, one is definitely the accelerated brain aging that's happening from the repeated..  traumatic events where it's doing that high school football college football and on pros you're just slamming anything like a good chunk of your life right and and and i did see one.  press release or some some article that was like.  74 out of 76 or something like nfl players or something somewhat don't quote me on those statistics but something that was very very almost like 90% of them had a beta amyloid beta plaques in their brain and towel tangles in the brain that were characteristic of alzheimer's disease yes, there's 76 out of 79 and this is post post death right post hard. yes. yes exactly. that's depression. that's after birth. yes, they gave birth and they got depressed because they if i was man, that's all they got hit.  but yeah, so the other really interesting thing about this traumatic brain injury is the effects on behavior. you mentioned to you ran over your ran chase car and jumped on the truck and fell off of it. that's impulsive behavior. that's not a normal thing. you don't just chase after a truck and try to jump on it while it's moving. athletes and fighters and like really, that's a really common, like that sort of impulsive behavior. it's super common for fighters..  so, well, there definitely there's one aspect of the....  fighting culture. i mean, you know there yeah, that's part of it's also what leads you to do that in the first place is you have this ability to do like.  a lot of them, i mean, i think before they ever got any brain damage whatsoever, they're impulsive people. that's what led them to do fighting in the first place. i see, i think that was part of the... i don't know. i mean, i'm guessing. certainly. i'm guessing based on my own life. right. so i don't know. yeah, i think that, you know, people....  so, impulsive behavior that's....  related to impulsive regression that could be self-directed..  like suicide or self-harming it can also be like aggressive towards others.  impulsive behavior can be like not long-term planning where you're just you know not you're not weighing out all the possible you know events that can occur and what's more likely to happen or not, you know, you just impulsively do something there are polymorphisms that are you know related to serotonin related genes that are associated with that because serotonin plays a very important role in regulating impulsivity so people that are already genetically predisposed because they have a polymorphism again that gene variant that i was describing earlier when i talked about apoe.  they have a gene variant in serotonin synthesis gene or in the release or in the transporter or in the receptor..  they've shown that there are associations with these and.  and pulsivity. you know, saratone is one of the things that happens. i've talked about this before in the podcast. you know, you can deplete people of saratone by taking away their trip to fan..  and they become impulsive..  they become impulsive in terms of impulsive aggressive things, you know, when they do sorts of tests..  and that's partly because what's happening is behavioral disinhibition..  behavioral disinhibition is....  you know, there's signaling that's happening that's going on from the orbital frontal cortex part of the brain and it's happening it's signaling to other regions of the brain like the amygdala and i don't understand exactly.  how serotonin does this or what its specific role is, i'd have to really dig into more neuroscience for that. but i do know that it does play a very important role in that when you take away the serotonin, disinhibition occurs, which means.  dis inhibition means now, usually you're having inhibitory signals happen that say, okay..  you know, you can't just go out and, you know..  do something crazy. you can't do it. your brain knows that and there are certain signals that are happening..  when you take away serotonin, those signals go away. and so now that inhibitory signal isn't there..  um..  this is something that i, you know, like i was doing some reading on some of these nfl players..  that have gone crazy and committed suicide..  like junior sao, i think, is one, who shot himself in the heart, you know, because he specifically wanted his brain to be examined. and there was another football player, i don't recall his name, but he also committed suicide..  i think he shot himself in his heart as well..  and then there was a pro wrestler..  i don't know his name, but....  he liked an emergency beside yeah, so these are all.  you know, there's probably multiple things going on, the orbital frontal cortex..  so that plays a very important role in the habatory actions..  but when things start to get messed up in that region of the brain, including....  the serotonin and i think like i mentioned.  the inflammation in the brain when you generate e2 series prostaglandins, which happens when there's inflammation in the brain..  you.  they've shown, they've shown this in many different studies in mice, use inhibit the release of serotonin..  so you take that in and out of by itself and you're talking about not having as much of that serotonin plus the damage to the orbital frontal cortex and all these things are compounding, you're talking about like just massive changes in behavior that are occurring..  then on top of that you may have someone that is like you said they did go into these you know sorts of.  sports for a reason they're already impulsive. so you're talking about the may already be genetically predisposed. they may already have some sort of alteration in their serotonin function..  and now they're depleting their serotonin release on top of that and they've got damage to their orbital frontal cortex and it's like these things are compounding to cause just total impulsive behavior.  and where they become aggressive and they do crazy things that they normally otherwise wouldn't do because they'd have that impulsive, i mean sorry they'd have that inhibitory signal saying no don't do this you can't do this like..  so, you know, i think it's very damaging in that....  and respects of changing the behavior of these people too..  where they just become even more..  you know impulsive and aggressive and they're already you know in this in the case of fighters are already fighting it's already a culture thing, you know, so.  i.  it's something very interesting with the serotonin system also and the interaction between inflammation and serotonin..  um.  they've even shown the opposite like when you take people and you give them an acute dose of like an ssri.  and you flood the brain with serotonin, just acutely, just for like, you know, a couple of hours..  people become more adverse to harming others..  like when you do give them a, you know, like one of those questionnaire things, they become more adverse to harming others..  even at the expense of saving other more people..  so, sir tonan somehow regulating....  you know these times..  i don't know. you know, and there's neuroscientists and philosophers and all this that are doing this research and trying to understand. it doesn't make sense so that happy people would be more kind and less likely to harm others. and i've found personally that people that are most depressed are the most likely to fucking slash and burn. those are the people that want to take everybody down with them. it's usually the people that are really depressed that are looking to make other people feel bad. yeah. i think happiness is a component, but i also think the impulsivity is another component that's important. it seems that serotonin..  if that really is what's going on, that giving someone a large dose of serotonin would actually make them less likely to want to harm other people, that's a pretty significant thing. yes. that study was....  published i don't know like 2010 or so i think and.  there.  they're looking into, they're doing a lot of follow-up studies on that. there's a difference between giving someone an acute dose of serotonin flooding their brain and doing it constantly because when you're constantly doing it, then there's feedback loops and you start to decrease the amount of serotonin receptors in the brain. but anyways, just the fact, what they're trying to understand is what is serotonin doing? why is it that by giving someone a huge dose of it, they become more adverse to harming others? and i don't know the answer. it just seems like they'd be happier, right? i mean, if you're serotonin....  part of its function is to promote happiness, right? so this is one of the reasons why ssris are termed anti-depressants because people are on depressants. they take these.  regulates their start to one and gives them a big uptake in it and then whoo they feel better.  um..  i don't know if this is clear or cut, but it does..  there's a lot of fact that some simplifying should have. it does affect mood. it does. you do feel better. they've shown also the serotonin ssri's effect paint like you paint, so you actually feel less pain..  so it's not just a matter of feeling happier, it's also a matter of not feeling as much pain. and there's similar pathways between physical pain and social pain..  i have a friend who had depression issues and before being on ssris, he was like really angry. like fuck everybody, fuck this guy. like he would just say horrible things about people once he got on the antidepressants all that one away. now, couldn't care less. whether the people do, couldn't care less like who cares. like someone's doing something bad or someone's saying something bad or what it is like, i don't care. just doesn't bother me. i don't want to harm that person. you know, it's a complete shift in his mindset. yeah, saratonein does affect that aggressiveness. like it's definitely playing a role. it was more of a lash out sort of a thing. i think there's one of the issues with depression..  is that people that are depressed and people that do have depression issues, they kind of want to bring other people into their world..  almost like they feel like..  that other people being happy is somehow taking something away from them..  you know, yeah, yeah, i do i think you know that they want to.  surround they want other people to be miserable miserable with them i think in this sense also where it's like because it's justification. it's like i'm here and then it must be okay, and you know if everyone here is also here with me then yeah, then i'm you know it's not i'm not abnormal. there's not something wrong. i've always wondered how much of that is what's going on psychologically? how much of that is what's in their life? and how much of the psychology and how much of what's going on in their life? like what kind of feedback they're getting on a day-to-day basis in their life is actually regulating their human neurochemistry yeah, no, there is a very complex interaction going on between the environment and the neurochemistry and this has been demonstrated you know in in a lot of different animal studies. you know where it's like.  so you can actually alter someone's serotonin system by....  having an early life, you know, stressful event..  happen. so.  you know, like in the case of mice, an early life stressful event is when the pups, when you're born, and you're a pup, and you're not nurtured as a pup..  so when you're nurtured, the parent mice will lick the pups and when they get licked, they release serotonin in their brain when they're really, really young..  and when it happens, when they release their tonarine to bring them to really young, it's all sorts of feedback, epigenetic feedback loop. so epigenetics is changing the expression of their genes without actually altering the dna nucleotide sequence, like appalling morphism is different sequence of dna..  but epigenetically, they'll change the receptors in their brain that respond to like oococorticoids, like stress hormones..  and they, so when they have serotonin there,.  they increase the amount of those receptors, which means when they have more receptors to glucocorticoids..  uh.  your body doesn't make a shoot as much cortisol and much much of much of those glucocorticoids out because it has a lot of receptors there it's a feedback.  so they're calmer, they're happier, they're not as....  you know, anxious, but if you take that away and those pups don't get licked, they don't make serotonin in the early development. and those glucocorticoid receptors you don't have as many. and so the body is constantly, it's like in a stress state and these mice grow up very, very anxious, fearful, just, you know..  they're there they're they're.  brains develop differently. isn't that the same with children that grow up in orphanages where they don't get cut old and yeah, i mean.  that's what i would be that's what i think it seems likely that.  and you take that in combination so you've got someone who's already genetically predisposed..  i like the serotonin system because we're talking a lot about that. they already have a polymorphism. polymorphisms are common. you've got people with polymorphisms in....  serotonin transporters, serotonin synthesis genes or their receptors. so they're already kind of vulnerable. they're not making as much serotonin or they're not responding like normal. so they're already genetically vulnerable to that. and then you couple that with an early....  stressful event..  and then it just screws things up even more..  and also, diet is coupled to it. i've talked about vitamin d regulating serotonin synthesis. epa regulates the release of it. they've shown that. i mentioned the e2 series, prostaglanins, inhibits the release..  when you put epa in it mitigates that. so having an anti-inflammatory omega-3..  you know is very important for people that are genetically predisposed to have their serotonin system screwed up. you take that person.  think about someone who's already....  on the fringe who's already waiting to be tipped over into mental illness or behaviors, types of behaviors that are non-productive..  and you take their nutrition, they have poor nutrition..  their inflammation going on, so all the energy is going sucked into the wrong place and not up here where it needs to be. and then you add stressful environment. i mean, you're talking about dynamite for mental illness. not just stressful environment, but negative feedback, like negative environment. yeah. poor relationships, poor friendships, there's a real hardcore negativity..  yeah, they've even shown actually in terms of the relationships this whole.  behavioral epigenetics, so to speak, is kind of what it's called and it's very interesting because it's talking it's like the relationship between what's happening in your environment and how that's changing, you know.  the neurochemistry and your brain either at the level of neurotransmitters or receptors or whatever, they've shown that another, so another thing that happens when you're....  cut old when you're young and they do a lot of these studies and in mice..  obviously, but....  you release, like for example when your mother licks you, you also, there's also oxytocin being released..  an oxytocin sort of that bonding hormone that's made where the mother bonds with the child, but also it's it's it's it's parina mate bond bonding as well.  and so when you take that away.  if you're not....  cautled or you don't get that attention early like that early attention from the mother in early life then what happens is that keep the the offspring grow up and they make less oxytocin like some epigenetic changes are happening we're now they're not making as much so now they grow up and they don't bond to their children.  and it perpetuates and they don't bond to their relations so they have poorer relationships..  similar thing happens with vasopressin, which is.  it's very a vasopressin, it's a lot of things, it's also an antidiuretic, but interestingly it's also made in the brain..  and it's important for males, like males respond to it in the context of.  meeting..  so, for example, they've shown in like prairie voles, which are rodents that are monogamous..  they have a higher level of receptors for that vasopressin in their brain compared to other volspecies that are not monogamous..  and when they take away, when researchers take away the ability, like take away those....  they basically antagonize the receptor so it can't bind bazaar pressin..  those peripherals which are monogamous and they mate for life..  all of a sudden that goes away. they become freaks, like polygamous and stuff. and they've shown this in like non-human primates too, where....  i think it was like almonkeys. they're monogamous and you compare them to rehus monkeys..  that are non-monogamous. the difference is also at those receptors for vasopressin, the monogamous ones have a high density of them in their brain. then another study came out looking at humans in a swedish cohort. they looked at males that were in monogamous relationships, that were married, had successful relationships, versus ones that were deforest, also ones that were just single. they found that there was an association again with these vasopressin receptors in the brain where the men that had failed marriages, for example, were not likely to even get married, they had less of these vasopressin receptors..  so it's really interesting that there's these social hormones that we're making that are really....  changed epigenetically. so these are also like for example in the prevals.  they release more of this bass oppressing.  when they're mating..  so like the act of mating with their monogamy, with their partner that they partner with for life..  uh... there's something that goes on with that meeting event that bonding event that makes them more makes them more monogamous exactly and it's happening i don't remember if i think it was happening at the level of the receptor yes they were making more of the receptors the meeting event uh... caused them to strengthen that bond even more you know the fascinating is that they could figure out some way to experiment with but nobos who are patently polygamous.  you know, but no, but no, but it's a freak. they just have sex with everybody really they only have the only like restrictions. yeah, they do. yeah, they're homosexual the only restrictions are the mother won't meet with the sons.  that's it. everything else is a free party..  and it would be fascinating if they could figure out a way to introduce that..  could you introduce it? yes!.  yes, you can make a transgenic and until recently transgenic by inform a diet or what you have to know so transgenic in the context of biology means that we take a piece of dna like a gene that does something.  and we put it into....  and you know a species are rodent and we make it like we can give rodents human genes and study their effects or we can give rodents genes that we give them more of them and see what happens. is that how the way to the apes got started? probably so. it seems like a fucking disaster side to it. we do it in rodents. i mean that's the minute. but if it didn't chimp's. so now with this we there was some limiting ability with the cloning techniques and how we do it..  but now we can do it more readily. so i think those studies are going to be done yet, but you're right. there's always the variability, the chaotic factor. it's like, well, what if? wake up. what if they become really smart? now they start welding. right. show up with the zoom, the chips of fucking welding masks on..  making swords. that would be kind of cool. yeah in a way. but also terrifying, yes. yeah..  well that's our mean..  a lot of people. the binobos aren't. the binobos aren't. which is really fascinating because they're like the least violent of all the primates, or one of the least violent. they almost never harm each other. maybe because they're having so much sex. i wonder, but chimps have a lot of sex too. they don't have as much sex as binobos for sure, but binobos have so much sex that they don't use them in captivity. you never see binobos at the zoo. and the reason being is that they're just so hypersexual, people would find defensive, because western culture is so ridiculously suppressed. if we had binobos in the zoo, we couldn't say, well, this is the thing. what you're looking at here is a normal natural expression of binobos. they like to have sex with each other. they solve disputes with sex. they use sex for bargaining. and we know that chimps use bargaining for sex. i had an old bit about it..  was because one of the first things that they ever discovered about chimpanzees when they started experimenting with money, started giving chimps coins and they could give those coins and get fruit with it..  so the first thing they did was give the coins the females and have sexual them..  it's not really the first thing. once they've realized the coins represented food, they would give the coins the females and the females would just have fucking stacks of coins to help the ceiling and all these males would be having sex with them. it's the associate of learning, you know, within, they've immediately been able to realize this. well, it's a prostitution is genetic..  um....  yeah, interestingly..  back onto the i mean i guess it's not really prostitution, but back on the whole lifestyle and how that changes your behavior. they've also shown that in mice when they female mice so when female mice.  when they're not cuddled. so there's a lot of this in behavioral, you know.  epigenetic stuff they're doing, they do a lot of studies on, okay what happens in early development? you know, what happens to the brain? like if you're not....  you know, if you don't get attention, you don't get the cuddling, the licking..  how do you grow up like what's going on and with the females what happens to is?.  when they don't get cuddled and licked and all that, they grow up with more estrogen receptors in their brain..  and they become more sexually receptive. so estrogen....  makes females more sexually receptive. and so what ends up happening is usually when you put a male mouse into a cage with a female mouse..  she may or may not meet them, you know, and if you put if you put one male mouse in to the cage with her.  this is normal, like a mass attack, cuddling and cuddling and all that..  you put the second male mouse in, let's say she made it with the first one, put the second one in, and she's not going to just mate with this guy. she already made it, she's not promiscuous, where she's just having sex and after sex. but what happens with those female myocicrope without?.  that cuddling, they have increased epigenetically, increased the expression of estrogen receptors in their brain, they become more promiscuous, so you put a male mouse in again, and it will make, and you put another one in and it made..  changing the sexual behavior now, you know, is there a correlation with human beings because human beings that come from troubled childhoods with a lack of love tend to be more promiscuous.  yeah, i mean....  i agree. obviously i can't make that statement..  but, you know, the more we learn about how these early life events are affecting behavior of our own brain and also of our offspring..  the more we can start to apply this to, you know, humans, i think it makes sense. you know, i think there's definitely a correlation between....  growing up in poverty, growing up, you know, without having that family there, that love, nurturing, supportive system, whether it's a single parent. it's not, it's not necessarily the case. i'm not saying like, i grew up in a single parent home..  and, you know, i'm not out there. freakin'. yeah, i'm freaking. getting my freaking on. kind of, i get my science freaking on, but, um, a little different. a lot different. yeah..  i'm just saying i don't want to say that everyone, of course, there's definitely exceptions. but i do think that our increased understanding at the biochemical level of how the environment changes the brain..  you know, whether we're talking about behavior..  cognitive function, you know, in general..  is very interesting and i think that it should be extrapolated and sort of you know apply to humans and in hopes that we can start to make society better you know. it's just so fascinating to me that a human being is essentially the product of an equation..  the equation of all these different hormones, all these different neurotransmitters, all these different epigenetic factors, all these different life experience factors, all these different things. that's what produces a rhonda patrick..  i mean, it's amazing. it's so....  it's so complex. i agree with you. i think.  there's a lot of, there's the things that we cannot control..  you know, and the things that we cannot control are....  you know.  are polymorphisms that we're born with, like me being born with apoi for..  i can't control that or it's hard to control, you know, being raised in a family where let's say, you know....  you're from a single parent family and your mom's working hard. she doesn't have time to you know you don't you don't get as much nurturing dad's gone, you know that's what i think you can't choose that. i mean you you're very young you know when you're young infant and young toddler. i mean these your your brain is very susceptible to all these you know environmental interactions. that's epigenetically changing you know the way your brain is working but things that you can change are you know as you you know diet diet's a really important one that you can change you know that the whole.  the ball game basically you know you're talking about i really think there's a complex interaction between.  you know, genetics, epigenetics..  die it..  and.  i'm not the only one that thinks that. i mean, there is. there's people researching all these different complex interactions, but i think....  what i like to focus on is the part that we can control and the part that we can control right now..  and that is our lifestyle. what we as an adult at least, obviously when you're really young, you're sort of a hold into your parents beating you and also....  you know, that's sort of unfortunate, but....  at a certain point, you know, it's like when you're able to realize what's going on, i think that trying to control what you can is really important. so getting a good diet, you know, things like....  getting enough omega-3s, epa, and your brain is literally an anti-inflammatory. it's extremely, extremely important. like, you know, the study where they're injecting people with cytokines that are causing inflammation that gives them depression..  and yeah, if they take epa with it, they don't get depressed. you know, that's pretty significant. that's massively significant. yes, it is. it's like it would be a huge issue with children as well. i definitely think it's a huge issue with children. they have these epa, there's the various....  fish oil gummy bears and these different little candies that you can give the children right, they don't really taste like candy. they can't taste quite a bit shittier than candy yeah, but they're sweet enough so they feel like a treat to kids. yeah, i think that you know it's.  extremely important, especially early on to get.  to get that epa i know i've talked about in the past dha is always you talked about because it's high there's a high level of it in the brain and i even talked about it in the context of krill oil i did some research after our last conversation. yeah we had a conversation about that that's one of the things that keeps coming up on my message board guys wanted folks wanted to do a question you about that like what is the difference between krill oil and fish oil and what are the benefits of krill oil and also how do you know whether krill oil is rancid because that appears to be an issue with krill oil.  really? yeah, you need me with grill oil. interesting. okay, well.  i'll tell you what i know and i'll definitely tell you what i don't go so the thing you know.  the reason dha and epr are very important is because they're both an important part of the brain. in terms of dha, it's very important because it's part of the cell membrane..  like neurons or astrocytes and other cells in your body, but particularly is concentrated in the gray matter of the brain. so it's very important..  the difference between fish oil and krill oil and this is something that i made a video on recently is that so fish oil.  is.  usually molecular distilled because they use it to fish have you know higher on the food chain and they've got concentration of more bad things like mercury and they're fat and so they molecularly distill it to get rid of that junk because we don't want to take a bunch of you know mercury and also they distill it because they want to concentrate the fish the epa and dha to make it more concentrated..  so what they do is they take the fit, the epa and dha, and they put this like ethanol backbone, they usually it has a glycerol backbone on it, which makes it a triglyceride. and they take that off and they do this ethanol backbone. it's part of the molecular distillation process, how they distill it, get the imperities away..  but then most companies leave it like that. they don't put it back in a triglyceride form so they have this ethanol backbone..  which is.  not recognized very well by pancreatic lifepaces in our small intestine..  so it doesn't get absorbed very well because that's an ethanol backbone. it's not common. it does get absorbed, but you just have to take more of it..  fish oil can be re-stairified into a triglyceride form where they put glycerol back on and that is much better because the triglyceride is what these pancreatic lipases are used to seeing. so they can absorb it. your small intestines can absorb it better. so the bioavailability is better, essentially..  so, but the problem is most, this oil supplements don't do that. there's a couple of exceptions. i know nordic naturals is one. i like them..  so, that's the fish oil, creel oil..  is mostly in a phospholipid form..  and.  so the thing about the phospholipid form, much like when we were talking about with liposomes is, so the thing with phospholipid form is that the dha and epa and creole oil can be easily absorbed by this malintestine for one, it can be absorbed in its intact form without having to undergo all this enzymatic cleavage stuff, so it can just be absorbed in tack and get transported to the cholesterol, a clylmicrons, like hdl, ldl, that can be transported there..  in full-talk form..  um, but....  so that's, you know, better a bioavailability, so to speak. and there's been a couple of studies showing that there's like a 40% increase in bioavailability from getting epa and dha in phospholipid form from krill oil versus getting in triglyceride form from fish oil. so that's kind of cool..  the thing that's really cool about krill oil is that this phospholipid form is....  is great because dha..  to get dha into the brain, we actually have a transporter..  which means you can get dha in the brain by just having it as a fatty acid, free fatty acid, and it can be carried into the brain. but there's also a specific transporter that has dha in a certain kind of phospholipid form called lysophosphatidelecoline. phosphatidelecoline is a phospholipid and it is in krill oil. and it's pretty awesome because that dha lysophosphatidelecoline can transport dha in the brain. it's actually an important way that dha gets into the brain. in fact, when they knock out that transporter in mice..  myis had 60% last dha in their brain..  so it's obviously an important pathway, the brain likes it in that form..  so i think for that reason, in and of itself..  crote oil is cool for the dha because it didn't that light so phosphatidal cooling form..  however, that's not the whole story. i think that....  because fish oil concentrates the epa and dha to like insane levels. i mean, even though creole oil is more bio-available, you know, it doesn't have high levels of epa or dha to speak. but your brain doesn't need that much dha. your brain conserves dha very, very well. the half-life of dha is like anywhere between like six months to a year. it's like very, very long. your brain is conserving it and the brain doesn't take up a lot..  well, you know, so on daily basis. i think it's....  something like four milligrams a day. so your brain isn't taking up a whole lot of dha..  but when it does take it up, it likes it in that krill oil form, that phospholipid form..  epa is the thing that your brain needs a lot of, a constant supply. and epa is so important for so many different reasons. we're talking about that whole neuroinflammatory pathway that was, you know, i started out talking about with, you know, traumatic brain injury with just normal brain aging, with, you know, inflammation in general, anything going on in the body, you know, any sort of gut issues, all that stuff, that's affecting the brain. and so, you know, having epa in the brain is so important, it's so important. and so i like to get a concentrated amount of epa from fish oil..  i get mine in triglyceride form, so i use nordic naturals..  because so i actually take both. i take krill oil and i take visual because i think the krill oil is awesome for the dha in that foster total cooling form and i think that the visual because i can get like.  i try to get two grams. they've shown multiple multiple studies i've shown, whether i'm looking at cognitive function, whether i'm looking at depression, whether i'm looking at impulsive behavior, or other types of brain functions and behaviors. two grams seems to be a consensus in terms of benefits. so that's 2,000 milligrams that we've got? yes. yes..  and so i get that from my nordic naturals epa that i take..  and then i get my dha from the crowwell..  the other thing about the krill oil is it has astasamthen..  which is a crot annoyed that is also accumulates in the rods and cones in the eye and also in the brain and the reason it does that is because it has a unique structure..  that is able to sequester..  singlet oxygen, which is produced by uv, like the sun. singlet oxygen is the thing that damages our eyes with age. it's one of those reactive oxygen species that i talk about. and it damages the rods and the cones of the eye, and it's a cause of age-related blindness, whether we're talking about macular generation, degeneration or other sorts of....  i debilitating diseases. so, as to zanthan, luting and zezanthan, these are croitenoids that are really, really good in the cumulin in the eye because they're like basically every time around the sun and that blue light hits..  which has the single oxygen in it, it captures it and it stops it from damaging. brain and also eyes. so acetanthans really cool. it's also been shown in clinical studies to improve hdl, to have lower oxidation, lower oxidative stress, all these good sorts of goodies that come along with it. which i also think are really cool. i like acetanthans..  in terms of rancidity..  i personally, another reason why i take nordic nachels is because of the isolate their visceral under nitrogen conditions, meaning there's no oxygen present..  in order for these omega-3s to get damaged, they need to be oxidized..  it's a part of the whole distillation process, depending all that stuff you're exposing into oxidative damage. so the fact that nordic naturals does all that in a nitrogen condition, there's no oxygen presence. it's kind of awesome..  now the cruel oil rancidity..  i wasn't aware of how rancid it gets just because i'm sort of new to the krill oil field. i just did a lot of reading on this dha phosphatical cooling form. it's probably similar situation, right? probably is. but acid amphen is a very good, it's also good at preventing lipid proxidation..  so it's doing some good studies, it's an antioxidant, it's preventing a lot of that rancidity just a matter of maybe how much has stenthens in there. that's possible, i've seen various doses, so maybe more as stenthens would help prevent the rancidity in that regard, but that would be....  you know, one thing that i would....  look for if you're getting the crow will try to get a higher level speaking of macular generation and eye issues. yeah, what.  what specifically is a good thing to take for vision? i've heard corsetin is that what it's called? corsetin, yeah. corsetin is supposed to promote healthy vision. even better than that is lutin and zia's anthem.  yeah, the team as well. there's a thing. there's a pure has a macular health packet. uh-huh, okay. or some supplement. they say that has both that loot that's how you say it. ludian ludian, yeah, ludian and.  yeah, i'm not, i mean that's, of course, the thing is just got generalized mechanisms where it activates..  nrf2, which is a transcription factor that activates glutathione. so it's one of those broad spectrum, kind of like the curcumin, where it turns on a lot of good genes in the body..  but really, we're talking about the idha, ludin and zizanthin..  that.  they're really the main ones. and leading in d.s. anthen are present in like green plants. cale's really high in it..  is it keeny? you know these things? yeah, it has all these things. this pure one the one that i take has has leading it has zsx and zx and and of course it in as well as well as.  and acetyl-el-cyteen. anacetyl-cysteine. sistine. is that what it says? yes. so actually that's another, anacetyl-cysteine is another way that you can activate nrf2 and also glutathione. and it's also potentantic oxidant. you know, i don't know it..  it's not like a general thing that's specific to the eye, it's more of a..  sorry, not a specific thing to the eye. it's more a general thing. it can induce glutathione synthesis. so it's one of those things that are....  you know, good for multiple cells, but....  if we're just talking about the eye, looting and de-zanthin, like if you look at other tissues..  the only place you find it is in the eye, in the rods, in the cones, in the eye, and in the brain. that's it. that's where it accumulates..  whereas the enacetyl cysteine gets in like multiple cells. it's just doing a general antioxidant thing so having the lutein and xeosantin that's part of the i think about this i make a smoothie every morning.  which has a lot of care on it and.  other greens, but it's got a high concentration of lutean and seizance and also my multibitum has it as well. i think i'm confusing corset in with something else because i think it was lutean that was thinking about because i don't even think this pure mature. that's probably what you were thinking about. yeah, lutean is, of course it does something else, right? yeah, it's a polyphenol. yeah, it's good. i mean, it does a lot of good things. you know, that....  a lot of the mechanisms by which these polyphenols work is through that.  it's slightly toxic. it activates all these different genes in our tissues that are detoxifying enzymes like glutathione and other reactive oxygen species scavengers and things like that. so nst-ylcystine has been shown to activate all the glutathione genes. so it's like it's a....  it's one of those mechanisms where it's like it like i mentioned before the hormatic response it's kind of like that where it does something like that..  generalizing you talked earlier about something that i always thought was bullshit that um.  that's that that that herbal shit that everybody always prescribes and people are sick echinacea i always thought that was nonsense. i don't.  i don't know if it is or not. i just, i mentioned it because i know that it's in people's minds. it's an herbal thing. yeah, it's one of those ones that people is taking a couple of drops of academy when you're sick. i thought it never did anything. i never felt any increased healing or recovery from colds..  i honestly have no idea if it's real or not because i haven't read about it enough. i mean i think the best thing to do like we were talking about is....  making sure you don't have a lot of inflammation going on making sure you're healthy like that's that's gonna be the way to have the best immune response you can possibly have when you are exposed to something pathogenic it's fascinating the way human beings work because we always go to try to fix it once it's broken and don't try to prevent it from being fixed like there's a there's a lot of money there's a lot of money in health supplements but there's a lot of money and like homeopathic remedies once you're already sick right like i'm.  remember i don't remember who gave it to me, but i remember this stuff. it's like these little.  like little sugar!.  capsules. they're at the top and pouring them out. i'm like, i'm eating sugar. was it homeopathic? yeah. i'm like, this is nonsense. no, no, this is amazing homeopathic remedy for colds. i go, this is fucking sugar. you know what that is? it's a placebo effect. is that what it is?.  yeah, yeah, i think that's stuff called you know talking about no like you pop the top of it's like sugar crystals no, i've never i have no idea what you're talking about but i do know that homopathic stuff is.  uh....  there's just no way that can be effective the way that diluted to the to the point where there's like one molecule of the compound in it's just crazy i did i was given to given that once and i took one of that i didn't know it was homeopathic but i thought it was like on a car something i took it but it was like little tiny little cap like sugar things inside of it and i could tell just by the way i shook the capsule i didn't pop it open. maybe i was supposed to i don't know i just took the capsule.  but anyways, that's....  and what is onaka?.  arnica is anti-inflammatory herb, antimicrobial, and it's used for mouthwash kind of thing. it's potent and inhibiting..  aerobic bacteria, bacteria that are aerobic, sog..  so that's....  i haven't done a ton of research on an article, but that's one thing that it does do..  golden ru is another one that's always partnered with echinacea. golden seal. golden seal. right, that's right. no, you're right. you're bringing back memories from me. is that a horse shit too? i don't know, because i just haven't looked into those. i haven't looked into those. so soon it is. i know the things that are good are the polyphenols, chorsatin and cermin, turmeric in general because of the turmeric own..  the anesthetial cystine, you know, aflipobic acid is another way to increase glutathione that's also in part important for mitochondrial function. so you know, there are there are good things and who knows some of the apococasins some people say yeah, yeah, aflipobic acid is interesting because my actually my mentor.  key is one of the pioneers that showed when you give off a lipoic acid to old rats..  should this like i don't know.  15 years ago i guess..  it made them young again like their brain it like made their brains young so when you gave them to old rats it was like reversing brain edging and how did they administer it was an intravenous?.  you know, i don't remember. i don't remember if i was in convenience or not i can easily check that check that out but alpha lipoic acid does get absorbed and actually gets absorbed better when it's not taken with protein interestingly enough, huh because it bind usually it's something we make in our cell like plants make it it's in you know, it's in food that we eat and it's also you know, we have we make it in our body but.  when it's complex to protein for some reason and i don't it's been so long it's been quite a few years since i read about this mechanism, but something about it um.  it doesn't get absorbed because it's like getting cleaved away or something with the protein so actually taking alphalipobic acid supplement should be taken on empty stomach i'm sorry. yeah, no, it's just which is kind of different than other foods where you take them with more people like.  listen all this information..  there's a lot of people listening to this podcast right now like fuck.  there's too much to really take any consideration. there's too much like okay awful okay, so they need some of that but i don't want it protein. okay, when do i take it? okay? liposomol glutathione is that legit? okay, i need a lot. i need a lot. okay, so i'll take turmeric and then i'll get my the same thing that i would get from out you know, these people on the subway right now writing on their hands right. i like trying to.  put all the shit in their head.  how much stuff should you take a day?.  how much of this can you get from your food? can you get any of this for your food? absolutely, like there's apple i poke at in your food. i mean obviously when you're cooking... protees, i think..  oh, you know, i think that it's....  you know joe, it's been so long i can't recall which ones have the most of it it's it's in a lot of foods, but in terms of concentration wise i forgot.  but the thing is is that, you know, like i'll take alpha lipo guys, so it's not part of my staple..  you know, what i really, really focus on is on micronutrients that are part of all these biochemical pathways that are going on in all of our cells, including our brain, those things i want to make sure i'm getting. that's key. so getting the omega-3s, getting my epa, tha, getting vitamin d, you know, magnesium, getting all my minerals, calcium, magnesium, getting that right, making sure i get all that stuff, vitamin c, like all, i need all those micronutrients..  and i want to make sure i get that. that's most important..  the other stuff..  you know, like....  the taking the curcumin or the turmeric and glyothione, things like that. those are more, i think, other measures that you can, i think, first and foremost, healthy diet, making sure you're eliminating the inflammation at the source of it, which is making sure you're not causing too much inflammation, but eating sugar and refined crap just eat. you want to make sure you're eating a lot of micronutrients, eating your meats that are not all crazy..  processed? teacher council. yeah. nitrates flat. nitrates. nitrates. nitrates. nitrates. nitrates. nitrates. nitrates. nitrates..  i try to... i try to... i try to....  night oh this big will nitrates aren't used for.  curing. no, they're in place. they're in all plant, like everywhere in nature. nitrites are used to cure meat and like, lunch meats and a lot of bacon i think has it. the difference is that....  nitrites can form nitrate..  nitro-sumines..  which are.  potent carcinogens. so they basically what they do is they bind to your dna and they form this bulky adduct on your dna..  and what happens is when your cell tries to replicate, so that's dna damage, a bulky addict. when i trust them, they interact with their dna and then when the cell replicates, it's like you can't, the....  replication machinery, you can't recognize that dna sequence because there's a big thing sitting there and so it just puts anything there and it's actually associated with a specific type of mutation. i think it's a g to t1. it's been a while, but that causes that's associated with cancer, which is why it's labeled as a carcinogen..  so nitrites can form that..  mostly because they're in an accurate solution, they can form nitrous acid, which then can react with amines which are everywhere in proteins, like amino acids, amines, so they react with that in form, can form nitrous amines..  so.  und das....  not a good thing and nitrates you can form.  nitrates can form nitriots like in the saliva. we have like bacteria in our saliva that can do that and it's i've seen.  studies everywhere and anywhere ranging from like um.  5.  5 to 20% or something like that where it can form nitrates. or sorry, nitrates. nitrates can form so eating a lot of plants..  can form nitrous saliva which get into your system but it's significant in the mouth where it can be toxic well so well there is i don't remember like there what.  the toxicity, i think that there is something that can happen..  but so there's a nitrates can form nitric oxide..  which is a vasodilator, it's kind of a good thing. and actually they use sometimes they use that to help people with hypertension..  and i tried to can also form that..  but it depends on....  whether or not there's enough antioxidant around, like vitamin c or other antioxidants, because nitrites, because they form this nitrous acid in aqueous solution, they can immediately then go into nitrous and means. but if you have this reducing agent around, then you can shift them nitrites to form nitrous nitric oxide..  but so plants, right, which is good, but so plants, how a lot about them and see when you're eating the nitrates and the plants..  you're getting vitamin c, you're getting all these antioxidants with it. you know, vitamin c's and....  kale, celery, all that stuff. it's there. so they've done studies where they've looked at the amount of nitrous and means formed from either nitrites or nitrates..  and so for meat, like meat, nitrates that are uncured meat, and they've shown that nitrates don't form those as readily because it's forming the nitric oxide instead, especially because there's a lot of vitamin c around which inhibits the formation of the nitroceamine..  if you take the nitrites and they cured me, then....  you're not getting a lot of antioxidants unless you're eating them also with it..  but in the case where you're cooking the nitrites, cooking is dangerous because.  can be dangerous because.  when you're cock!.  water, you know, water's happy, you get water, and the night trides..  and uh maybe what did when he was doing i shouldches a office iortion version.  in the in the accuracy solution of water, form nitrous acid, which then react with degradation products of amino acids from like bacon, for example, like has protein, and they form nitrocymine. so cooking can form the nitrocymines, and you can ingest them. so cured bacon with chemicals, is that's what's bad for you? i'm not a big fan of eating nitrite stale, or even weekly. i think if you love bacon, why not just buy the stuff without the nitrites? yeah. they make it without it. you can get it at a butcher shop where it's not. right. yeah, not carefully treated. i think i've even seen it at berkeley bowl, like, where it's shopped. so it's not. so nitrites are bad, nitrates are plant formed. yes. nitrates can form nitrates. it's just, i know, is a little confusing and complicated but. and commonly misconstrued. they're commonly, yeah, they commonly get, um..  yes, so yeah, nitrates are not what are curing meat and nitrates are what's in plants and you can form them.  you can form nitrites from them, however, because of all the vitamin c and all that, they don't readily form nitrosamines. nitrosamines, which is a bad stuff, it's the carcinogen, that's what you don't want to form. it forms nitric oxide more readily. nitrites can form nitric oxide..  but they also form nitro semines. and particularly if there's not a lot of vitamin c or antioxidants around, they can get pushed towards that nitro semine state..  got it..  yeah..  yeah, that's overcomplicated. it's so overcomplicated. i've seen this switched on.  all over the place on the internet actually so..  yeah, it's almost... i know a lot about it because my mentor studied nitro-simmons and he was like one of the pioneering guys that like was talking about how this dna damage causes cancer. so i've....  he's told me about them, you know, so i know a little bit a little bit about them and he knows a lot more than i do so.  it just seems like one of those things where when you're talking about all these different nutrients you're talking about, it's like this is a real constant area of study for anybody who wants to be consistently healthy. anybody who really wants to have a really nutritionally balanced diet and optimize their health and their potential to recover from illness and prevent certain damage and free radicals and all the areas that....  could be problematic in our world and our diets. there's so much to think about. there's so much to calculate. i hear you. i think that um....  one of the main things i think that....  my advice would be it's a lot easier to focus on what you should eat..  then on what you shouldn't. and i think that more inclusionary diet is key. so focusing on what your body needs, you know, not only for short term, but what it needs for long term. focus on that more than focus on what you're eliminating from your diet. because it's just, first of all, if you focus on what you're limiting from your diet, then you're not gonna be getting all the good stuff that you need. that's also thinking a lot about loss. you're also thinking, i can't even eat that. it's just like, there's too many little.  it's easy to become caught up in a lot of minutia and i know this because i've been there..  and.  so, you know, getting caught up in all this little minutia, you know, it can take you..  forever to try to figure out what's going on and then in the meantime you're getting distracted from the important thing is not as what you need you know your body your body is very resilient and if you feed it what it needs.  you can fight off stuff, you're gonna age better, all these little chemical reactions and enzymatic reactions going on in all your cells, in your liver, in your kidney, in your brain, all these things are gonna keep happening because you're feeding it. and when you have a little bit of toxic stuff, guess what? all these pathways are ready because they're getting nourished or getting what they need that they activate and your body has protective mechanisms to make sure it doesn't get cancer. i explain that when you make reactive oxygen species, you can repair it..  or the cell will die, but all those stress response mechanisms, they require that you're giving yourselves what they need to do that. so if you're so focused on what not to eat, that you're not getting enough of what you need,.  then your body is you know capacity to do that isn't gonna be as optimal. so i really like.  i really think it's easier, especially for people that don't have a scientific background that don't have time. i mean, because it takes a lot of time to sit there and read through all the scientific studies and figure out what's going on in all the complex interactions. you know?.  i barely have time to do that and it's like i do this every day like i do research every day and on top of that in my spare time i do it and it's still.  overwhelming and i still can only get so much done and you have the education to deal with all the information and you understand what's going on right the mechanisms behind it yes well you know last time we were here we talked about.  some of the disinformation that even medical professionals.  guys who have written books without an understanding of the different, like we talked about vitamin e and the understanding of the different mechanisms involved in vitamin e absorption in the body. and people who have written books, they're incorrect about what's negative about high levels and what is good about high levels and what is how your body should be processing it and what different types of vitamin e there is. and that's just so, there's so many variables, there's so much going on. yeah, i think that in addition to so many variables and it being so complex, we're also continually finding out new things. i'm talking about studies that were published two months ago in the context of traumatic brain injury and some of these neuro stem cells..  it takes a continual.  searching of the literature, you know, to keep up to date with all the new research. and that's incredibly difficult to do when you're occupied full time as, for example, as a physician and your treating patients already overworked..  you know, these are things it's....  it's extremely difficult for a lot of physicians. first of all, they haven't been trained in a lot of these biochemical pathways in nutrition and mechanisms. i think that the training itself inherently is flawed..  and that's something that needs to be changed at the institutional level. you know, i think that....  doctors need to be..  there needs to be more of a focus on understanding how nutrition interacts with genes, how diet interacts with genes, how these complex biochemical pathways, why they need all these different micronutrients as cofactors to make enzymes work and all this stuff. that's lacking in the medical profession. i know that's lacking because i have several friends that are physicians and have told me and also because even people that aren't my friends that are physicians have told me that they don't get trained in this way..  so i think that's....  really, you know, that's one of the flaws in medicine, but in addition to that, you have doctors that work really hard, you know, and i....  i respect them. i think that they do to some degree, you know, they train hard, they work hard, and they're trying to somehow help people. they're trying to diagnose diseases..  to some degree that they do do that..  i think the problem is..  that they also can't keep up with all the new literature, they can't keep up with the new research..  and then there's the whole human component that comes in when you've got your patient that knows more about something than you do. sometimes ego gets in the way and you're immediate response to sort of a jerk..  knee response words like no this can't be true because i'm the the leader i'm the person that knows this and well especially when you're talking about things like you were talking about the study with the mice the showing that the the neurons are actually it's stimulating the stem cell growth. yeah, that this is also new.  and you're talking about something that's like a couple months old. yes. if your degree was in the 90s, good fucking line. no, it's true. it's, you know, it's....  هذهilda.  i do, like for me, i'm putting out some of these videos and i do this, you know, um....  sort of, i'm trying to do it more frequently, but....  some of my videos are a little more complex than the general..  educational video, i try to really be comprehensive and bring it home and sort of make sure i explain mechanism and context and all those things. and i've been getting emails from physicians that are thinking me because they're saying they never knew this and they don't have time..  it's really rewarding in addition to educating the public..  you know, like i think that's also very important. making sure the public, people that, you know, understanding how to prevent disease, understanding what you need to, to optimally, optimally, you know, perform as good as you can now and to age as best as you can. that's important, but it's also important for physicians to understand things that they didn't get..  they didn't get trained in and they didn't have time to read about. it's almost impossible. if you have a full practice and you're constantly treating people in a daily basis and.  exactly how much!.  education is involved in getting a degree in nutrition..  well, i mean, when you, if you're a doctor, if you're a general practitioner, how much of your time is it really spent learning about nutrition? and when you go to a doctor for advice about nutrition, you're almost better off just fucking googling it. yeah, i don't know how much time i think that relatively speaking to the rest of their training, i would say it's not much..  and, you know, also getting a new degree in nutrition is also, i mean, like i got a degree in biomedical science and i've done research on aging cancer and now i'm doing some nutrition research..  but i think that even getting a degree in nutrition has flaws because.  you know, i think that some of these....  some of the dogma with nutrition itself is been changing with new science and then getting people to like change their state of mind i mean, that's always harder to do especially when they've been you know spewing this out for years and and also that a lot of you know degrees and nutrition you know like they don't have a real hardcore science in some cases like a science background where it's like.  i like to change fields. i'm changing my field several times..  i started out doing chemistry looking at the very, very molecular level and then i went into aging research and then cancer and now i'm doing nutrition and now i'm even getting into the brain..  so i think that it's kind of cool to also have different perspectives, like, you know, where it's like, because you see things that other people have been in that field forever, don't see, you know, like, you know, the neural stem cells and like, i, there's not a lot of nutrition people talking about..  neural stem cells and things in nutrition that are important for that so.  it's sad..  yeah, it's definitely, it's hard for the average person to figure out what they should eat or what they should supplement. i know that you were saying that....  one of the companies you're involved with does like nutritional scans on people, you'll do like a blood work panel and then recommend what the person's deficient in..  yeah, so i'm not involved with them. i had done some, um, i done a couple of guest blog posts..  a little over a year ago to sort of, because i liked what they were doing basically. i liked the service-ape providing company. wellness fx..  well, this affects us because they are....  they're basically consumer based where it's like you sort of.  you don't have to go get a doctor's prescription to go get your blood work and to look at things like c-reactive protein, your vitamin d levels, your rbc magnesium, your lipid profile, these sorts of things omega-3, they measure epa and dha..  they also measure the omega-3 omega-6 ratio, which is also important. i mean, having too much of omega-6 fatty acids also leads to that inflammation, that generation of e2-series prostac landings in the brain, in the body, it's causing inflammation. so having a good omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is also really good. so they do that as well. and i think that....  people that are going to get these tests done and then they get their blood work and then they.  you know, while this fx has like a panel of nutritionists and other physicians that i'm not really familiar with, they help people interpret and to what degree they know what they're doing, i can't tell you. but the point is that you have that information, you can also learn a lot from the internet, but also you can....  look at your baseline and make dietary changes and start to see how things change like that's really important, you know this.  quantifying this quantified self movement, it's called where you're basically quantifying your own thing, you know, blood work and things like that and figuring out how to optimize yourself. that's a lot of work. it seems like it'd be really problematic to find a lot of rhonda patrick's out there though. i don't know how many of you there are..  i'm not blowing smoke up your ass because you're my friend and i love you. but if there is a hundred rhonda patrick's out there running clinics, it would be awesome. that means a hundred cities could have a place where you could go and you could get a someone who's really completely absorbed..  in this sort of research, like you are, give you a real systematic breakdown of your diet, of your, here's your profile, this is what you're missing, this is a fucking difficult tip. it is, well thank you for that compliment, but i, um,.  i think that getting the blood work done and looking at these different micronutrients and biomarkers and lipopanels is one aspect of it..  and i think the other aspect that i'm becoming increasingly interested in is getting the genetic data as well, like 23 in me. so i, you know, i'm....  you know, i'm trying to figure out a way somehow i can i'm getting more and more interested in because i'm looking a lot at these complex interaction between genes and diet and i'm trying to figure out okay, you have this polymorphism.  you being me, i have it, april before. what do i do to make sure that i can give myself the best chance of not getting alzheimer's disease?.  right. excuse me. what can i do for my father who is 65 years old now? and it's at a critical point. i got to make sure that if i don't somehow intervene now i make sure he's doing things right that he's going to get alzheimer's. and i probably want that even... i want to make sure he doesn't get it even more than i do, probably because....  you know, when you have it, it's....  i feel bad for all my family members, you know, but i won't really know. it's dealing with your close loved ones and then completely losing their mind and not remembering who you are..  i can't think of a worse thing that can happen, you know, except from death. watched a bunch of documentaries on people with alzheimer's and it's brutal. and like i said, i've seen....  the traumatic brain version of it in fighters slowly start to appear. and not just in real time, but in highly accelerated real time..  like, i've seen a guy go from being one way to two-three fights later, i see him a year later and he's a different guy..  and this is a fairly common. i see this, you can literally see the struggle in their eyes. wow. you can see the struggle in the way they form sentences. you know, some of the, you know, i talked about some things that are....  you know, possible to help, you know, people that are getting traumatic brain injury, repetitive traumatic brain injury. and obviously, i really, i really think that the apa we for genetic test is.  i would love to see that come into practice where we're talking adopted by athletic commissions. yes, i'd like to see that adopted by nfl. yes, i'd like to see it adopted by nfl. i'd like to see it boxing, you know, mma. i'd like to see all those types of athletic commissions adopted where it's like, you know..  i don't want to say, okay, well they're gonna say you're apoi before you can't do that because i hate to like take that away from someone.  i don't know, maybe people will figure it out and there's some committee form and they'll say, you know what, it's such a high risk that we just can't have you. it's like me and hema philly, i think, wants a sword fight. it is. it really is. it's just that bad. i mean, you're talking about going from just having that allele, i'm already freaked out because i've got a 2-3-fold risk of alzheimer's disease..  and you're talking about going from that to a 10 in some cases, you know, 10-15 fold..  increase risk and not only increase risk, it's an earlier onset. it changes the onset by seven years. so you're talking about getting it seven years, almost a decade earlier, than other people..  that allele, like having that isoform and it's just an easy test to do. 23m does it and doctors do it as well. there's a really recent study published in the journal of alzheimer's disease that reported neuroscientists using a cellular model of the alzheimer's found low doses of deltronine, tetrahydro-canabinol, which is thc, which is from marijuana, actually has been shown to reduce the production of hon..  ameloid beta and prevented abnormal accumulation, which is some of the early signs of the memory lost disease, which is hilarious, because marijuana has been known to give people short-term memory loss. i mean, it's one thing that potted itself constantly complaining about. the fuck was i just talking about? you know, that's like what, but only when they're on it. but when you are smoking marijuana or eating it, when you are intoxicated by it, the big thing is short-term memory loss. so it's interesting that you bring this up because in my whole traumatic brain injury quest, as i've been reading about recently,.  canabinoids came up on my radar because new studies have just recently come out related to also traumatic brain injury..  where they found, for example, that patients that were emitted to the hospital after a traumatic brain injury..  i think it was like a mild to moderate. so it was like glasgow, commascore, like....  4 or 5. it wasn't like a severe severe, like.  like totally like going to coma and all that. but they found that those people that were admitted.  after having a traumatic brain injury, those that had the highest levels of thc in their blood were the least likely to die. and it was like there was a dose-dependent thing where they saw people that had higher levels were much less likely to die in the hospital. so....  that sort of sparked my interest in what's going on. i did a short little research and i found out that also even in mice.  mines that were given a low dose of thc that was not high enough to have a psychotropic effect..  so they gave mice just a single load dose of thc either.  48 hours before the traumatic injury, so they induce traumatic injury in the mice, like they typically press the pressure on their little tiny mouse skulls, and or they gave it to them one to seven days after the traumatic event had occurred..  and what they found was that it dramatically reduced the whole neuroinflammatory..  pathway. there was less edema, there was less inflammation, less amyloid plaques were aggregated, so this is....  quite significant. so i started reading just a little bit more. i haven't done a ton of reading on this..  topics, so i really....  i'm no expert on by any means. so there apparently there is two different receptors, cannabinoid receptors..  in the brain. there's cb1 and cb2. cb1 is found on neurons, predominantly, and cb2 is found on the microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, which is really interesting because they're also found in the immune cells in the body. so it's like something about the cb2 receptor is.  specific to immune cells, whether we're talking about immune cells in the brain or in the periphery..  but what's interesting is that cannabinoid activation of the cb2 receptors in the microglia..  it prevents them from getting activated, prevents them from throwing out all sorts of cytokines and causing all sorts of neuroinflammatory cycles that happen..  i don't know exactly how. i think that it's also well known that cannabinoids have some sort of anti-inflammatory effect in general. so that is one likely mechanism..  and the other thing was the cb1 receptor, so they recently found....  this led me into this alzheimer's, there were studies. so the fact that it can protect from traumatic brain injury..  is and it's that it's an anti-inflammatory effect is also showing that this is relevant for alzheimer's. so when i did a search on that, sure enough, yes. it's like lots of studies actually had been done on the effects of cannabinoids on alzheimer's..  and so, um....  there was a recent study that showed that somehow the receptor, when you agonize the receptor and see if you want receptor on neurons,.  it protects, it does something where it's important for long-term and potentiation..  and it's kind of a confusing mechanism, but long-term potentiation is when you have, so during learning the learning process, when you're learning something new,.  you've got a synapse that's forming between the neurons and there's an enhancement in that synaptic....  signal so it's like.  it's enhanced, so it's solidifying that memory, which, whatever you're learning, it's making it stronger. and that's a very important mechanism for neuroplasticity, so making sure that you're going to remember something long-term, because you've enhanced that signal, it's going to be there..  and to do that enhance that long term potentiation..  you can um.  activate, you can cause more like activating types of signals, but you also get rid of the inhibitory ones..  and the cb1 receptor seems to somehow get rid of those inhibitory ones when it's activated..  and amoeleid beta plaques when they build up in the brain, they antagonize cb1 receptor. they prevent the cb1 receptor from doing that..  you know, roll it does in long term potential, potentialiation, which is part of the effects on memory, long term memory too..  now in terms of short-term memory, i don't really know. it's kind of interesting because i had the same thoughts i've heard..  that you know well short-term memory is affected. it's very stereotypical. you talk to anyone on the street they've heard that yeah, oh it's true 100% but i don't know.  you know, i just i would have to read a lot more on this topic, but there may be some sort of acute versus chronic effect where it's like there's something happening acutely.  while you're, you know, agonizing them while you're, you know, taking the cannabinoids and then versus the long-term effect. and maybe there's some sort of trade-off. maybe it's like....  short time..  some things affected..  but in the long term, your ability to have that long term potentiation is good..  so it's interesting, the cannabinoid, it's unfortunate that there's not a lot of research being done in that field. i think that more and more people are....  doing more research on it as all these studies are coming out you just can't ignore it yeah, well it's it's absolutely happening more and more especially now that there's money involved in it because of what's going on in colorado and washington state? there's so much money that's being poured into marijuana research now because people are starting to look at it in terms of well, this is like some seriously financially viable stuff like this is not just like some sort of a fringe thing the people trying to sneak in are the guys of medicine. this is a crop and we have to look at it as this is a commodity. i mean they're making hundreds of millions of dollars now in taxes these states are wow, they're awesome colorado is gonna be over a hundred million dollars is here washington state might surpass it and once all said and done i mean it's gonna be crazy and once the new elections start rolling in and these these options run the ballots for other states.  there's a lot of states that are economically challenged that are going to probably jump a board in california. it should be embarrassed that they have it, especially with fucking moon being jerry brown in sacramento. the whole thing is ridiculous. it should have been illegal a long, long, long time ago..  i think that there's going to be a lot more studies being done on the positive effects because....  they've looked at so many different things, the reduction of interocular pressure for people who have glaucoma, people who have wasting disease and aids, and all sorts of people who have appetite issues because of chemotherapy. i mean, you can go on and on and on, but now when you're finding alzheimer's, the anti-implamation properties of it, especially the differences between eating it and smoking it, you give you get more benefits from eating it. a lot of people that complain about chronic pain or hugely, they find it hugely beneficial. it's a really good plan. yeah, that's....  i think you're right, as more and more research comes out, there's going to be a positive feedback loop where it's like you just, in addition to these other progressive states like colorado and washington state, which are now..  it's recreational, recreationally legal, and it's not only that, it's generating income, which is like, you just can't ignore that. i mean, that's money. the money is too big at this point. yeah, and people have a hard time ignoring money. it's going to be really hard for them to take it away now because what happens is the states get addicted to that tax revenue. when you're talking about withdrawing $100 million in tax revenue, when the statistics here is where it gets really crazy, decreasing violent crime, decreasing dui-rs, or over and over and over, there's like, there's no negatives. there's like a god jumped off a roof somewhere. like, okay, that fucking guy might have jumped off a roof anyway. that's terrible. that's a terrible. high driving, even if you get an accident, you go in 10 miles an hour..  everybody's just bumping in each other. it's really relaxed..  high-driving accidents. i mean, we're talking about a brain injury. i mean, getting hit by a drunk driver, i mean, you're talking about. it's awful. well, it's just amazing, really, truly amazing, how few drunk driving accidents there are in comparison to how frequent the places where you can get alcohol as you're driving on a street. if you drive down the street, any street you drive down, you have drug dealers all over the place. every restaurant you pass is a drug dealer. every cvs store is a drug dealer. i mean, they're all selling drugs. they're all selling alcohol. i mean, almost every bar, i mean, of course, every bar, but almost every restaurant, almost every drug store, they're all selling alcohol. i mean, it's incredible the availability of alcohol. yeah. and if you take that into consideration, it's incredible how few alcohol-related accidents we really do have. what's interesting is that they're selling this drug that alcohol,.  it does a lot of damage..  alcohol does damage to your gut. i mean, you're talking about poking holes in your gut like sugar does..  it does that. it also, obviously, your liver, that's what most people are familiar with, but the brain is my concern, particularly because....  i can't repair damage as efficiently as my husband who doesn't have this apoi 4. so when you drink and they've even shown in studies people with an apoi 4 allele that drink alcohol..  even increase their risk of alzheimer's even more, because when you're talking about inducing cell death..  then if you can't replenish that..  you know, sell death if you can't repair that damage..  and apoi for can't, we have that apoi for it, it impairs the ability to grow new, like i said, grow new neurons and repair damage and that's very important. it's also, it's so bad because it's like also causing more aggregation of, you know, amyloid beta and all that. so that's, the neurons are primed to die and when you add alcohol on top of that..  it's causing that it's tipping them over to death that stress plus stress like i was talking about so you know, i don't i don't drink a lot.  it's fun and i've always done it in social situations..  but after finding out about my april before every time i am in a social situation i'm having a dinner with a bunch of friends and they give me a glass of wine and even though there's some benefits with polyphenols and the wine. resveratrol and wine. yeah, resveratrol is one and but the problem is is that i the bent the.  it's like the pros and cons, the cons outweigh the benefits in my mind because alcohol does so much damage that i can't repair..  so if you and i are drinking a glass of wine.  you know, let's just assume that you don't have this 8-poet 4 because 1 and 4 people have it. there's 3 people in this room, it's likely that, and it's like, i'm the one. me..  you know, so....  this got it. look at them. but you know what i'm saying is that you know i have to think about this interaction between the genes and the diet and me drinking the alcohol now i know that i can't repair that damage as efficiently.  so it changes my future behavior in sense. and some people would probably say, oh, you're not going to enjoy life. and it's like, i'm not saying i don't ever drink. and i do a lot of other really, really good things to counteract that. and i'm trying to figure out more good things. but i think that knowing that, for example, exercise, exercise also was very, very important for people with april before. and they've shown this in studies, that people that exercise more..  that have an apoi for a liel are less likely to get the alzheimer's. so this is where this complex interaction between genes and environment come into play. but it's interesting that you know cannabinoids which are not found in every cbs store or any store like within a block radius actually have the opposite effect on the brain. they actually help prepare the damage. they actually decrease the inflammation..  you know, it makes people like me who are very hyper aware of, you know, this alzheimer's disease and all the mechanisms that are accelerating and how to you know, stay bit off. it makes me think well, that's kind of interesting that something that's.  you know, seems to be beneficial from our studies that we've had published so far..  so when will we see that adopted in the medical community? are we going to see changes? are we going to start to see people given cannabinoids?.  you know, i don't know if they're trying to figure out a way to uncouple the....  psychotropic effects from the anti-inflammatory effects. i'm almost certain that people are trying to figure that out and i don't know if that's going to work or not, you know there may be something about the psychotropic effect of it that's also important for you know there's no telling biology. i mean, it's it's the way it is for a reason, you know.  but it's.  it's something that's that's.  on my mind. it's on my mind now that i, you know, especially that i know i have this apoi for a leal, which completely changes a lot of, you know..  things that when i think about exercise, i don't think about exercising the sense of.  oh, i need to lose weight. i want to stay tall and look good. i think about it. if i don't get exercise..  i am dramatically increasing my risk of alzheimer's disease. if i don't get that exercise, my brain is going to atrophy, and i'm going to, it's going to be more likely that i'm going to lose my brain function, and i'm going to change my behavior in older age. and that..  terrifying. terrifying. you know, so..  you know the exercise..  it's becoming like, you know, i think people still really think of it in terms of.  in a losing weight..  it's just it's doing so much more. it's doing so much more and.  i'm really glad that people do it to lose weight because at least they're doing it. but they even just like....  a couple of weeks ago a study came out showing that exercise literally causes your muscle cells to detoxify something that we make called kanyurine, which is actually a byproduct of trip-to-fan metabolism..  i've talked about before in our conversations, you know, as a precursor to serotonin, right? so trip to fan has to get into the brain..  and when it gets into the brana makes her tonin..  well, trippi fan can also form something called kainyurnin. and when it forms kainyurnin, this happens under like....  conditions of stress..  or.  when there's some sort of pathological invader, so it's an important part of the immunological response..  so, kind urine needs important to make t regulatory cells. so, i mean, you obviously want to be able to have this response mechanism..  however, when you make too much kind-you're in..  not only is tryptophan not being made into serotonin in the brain because it's getting sucked into this other pathway..  in addition, chignurin can cross the blood brain barrier, and it can form something called quinolytic acid, which is like a neurotoxin. it literally causes like too much glutamate to be released and it causes excitotoxicity and cell death, and it activates microglia, so it causes inflammation. if you already have amyloid beta plaques in your brain, great, more activation of microglia. you're going to keep making more. it's like....  feeding into that already terrible cycle. so exercise causes muscle cells to like convert that chignourine into another byproduct that can't get into the brain..  so, you're talking about another way that exercise is protecting the brain. in fact, in the study that was published in cell, they found that these mice, they did some mouse models..  when they injected the mice with canyoning..  um..  it got into the brain and caused all these neurotoxicity effects, but it also caused depression..  causing a depression which....  of course, you know, inflammation in the brain..  deplates the ability of the brain to release their tonin..  and that's one aspect of how inflammation's causing depression. so you're not making serotonin tip cause depressive symptoms in this mice, and they do all sorts of little studies where they look at exploratory behavior and all sorts of things in little mice. obviously humans are way more complex. but....  then some people. so when they made the mice exercise, the depressive symptoms went away. the neurotoxicity that did better on learning memory tests..  yet another reason why exercise is freaking awesome for the brain for depression.  for me to make sure i'm not gonna, you know get alzheimer's so for everybody for everybody we're out of time unfortunately. we just rattled through three hours at an accelerated rate yeah, you just blasted through yeah, you were enough trance you were in a information disseminating trends well, i certainly hope people learn they barely learned they're gonna have to go over it again with a no pad and they're gonna google a shit out of it and and i think we got a lot out of this the holy shit every time we talk.  next time we gotta talk about cryotherapy. okay. this is something that i've started getting into recently. oh my god, we gotta talk about that. but god damn, this was awesome. totally awesome. so much cool stuff. yeah, we'll talk more about behavioral epigenetics. because that's fascinating. yes, we'll do it again in month or so whenever. thank you so much. it's always awesome. your website..  yeah, so found my fitness calm is where you can find me and all my my stuff found my fitness on twitter found my fitness on twitter and also i've got a new android app coming out this afternoon so you can find it launch. yeah, so you can find it there awesome and also i've got my patreon where i've now about to make a mile another my my first milestone, so i'm pretty stoked about it and which means i'm gonna have to step up my game and get some more.  creative works out there for people to listen to beautiful awesome you're fantastic. thank you so much so is the pleasure run the patrick lee's and gentlemen. all right tomorrow joe perry from arlesmith. ha la see you soon. bye.  who have我們的 cancer?. \n",
