      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk69.wav :  some stuff's going down basically well the choking though. it's not as dangerous. yes, it's not the the issue with choking is. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk70.wav :  any grappling you're gonna develop micro trauma and you're gonna have disk issues as you get older you're gonna have just just a lot of a lot going on with spine. uh-huh, you know, and so there's some trauma but for the most part the choking is not too dangerous. there's one repeated issue that's been happening a lot lately. never happened in ufc. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk71.wav :  but it's been happening in small organizations and it's a very particular move where someone will go for a takedown. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk72.wav :  which is, you know, you try to, they're standing up, and you try to take the guy down.. \n",

      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk74.wav :  gets the guy in what's called a guillotine choke and a guillotine choke is your head is trapped under the armpit and you have your forearm underneath the neck and you're pulling up on the neck and then the person who's caught in the guillotine tries to take the person down. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk75.wav :  by like picking them up and trying to throw them and they land on the guy's head and that people are becoming paralyzed from it.. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk76.wav :  it's happened several times. it's happened in training a couple times and it's happened a couple times in fights, but it's enough of an issue where it's starting to scare the shit out of me. you know that guys who get caught in guillotine try to slam their way out of it. they try to pick a guy up and slam their way out of it instead of trying to be technical and grab a hold of their hand and try to.... \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk77.wav :  work your way out of it. it's just because that choke is so sudden when you get caught in it. it's such a nasty choke that the there's like one or two seconds where you have with a guy who's really good where you have to breathe.. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk78.wav :  where, you know, otherwise you're.... \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk79.wav :  you're pretty much going to go unconscious. yeah, so that's one thing i was wondering with the choking specifically was, you know, because,. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk80.wav :  choking, you know, you can, to some degree, cause some hypoxia in the brain. so, you know, you're not causing ischemic damage, which is like no oxygen getting in the brain, but you may have reduced oxygen. and the body compensates for that. the body will, because it senses that less oxygen is getting in the brain, it increases blood flow, you know, as a compensation.. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk81.wav :  but if that can't compensate, what happens, you know, you'll start to eventually like your motor control will get affected. and i was wondering if they use that as a technique.. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk82.wav :  like because. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk83.wav :  then that they're because they're choking their opponent. now their opponent's motor control gets, you know, affected. no, the goal is just put the guy to sleep.. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk84.wav :  which is even worse because that's the next step which then you become you know that happens all the time. yeah, so and there is you know that that hypoxic damage you know there is damage occurring what kind of damage is occurring when i get choked out completely asleep well completely asleep. so you're talking about you know not enough oxygen getting the brain for just you know a few yeah a few seconds one of the thing that can happen is that you can have a lactate buildup. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk85.wav :  so.... \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk86.wav :  so your brain, so you have neurons and you have supporting cells in your brain called astrocytes and gleocells, but astrocytes are a specific type of gleocells. \n",
      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk87.wav :  they're really important. they do a lot of things for the brain and they make up like 50% of the human brain volume.. \n",

      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk822.wav :  and where they become aggressive and they do crazy things that they normally otherwise wouldn't do because they'd have that impulsive, i mean sorry they'd have that inhibitory signal saying no don't do this you can't do this like.. \n",

      "E:\\W4732 Computer Vision\\Final Paper Data Proc\\568\\chunk842.wav :  part of its function is to promote happiness, right? so this is one of the reasons why ssris are termed anti-depressants because people are on depressants. they take these. \n",
